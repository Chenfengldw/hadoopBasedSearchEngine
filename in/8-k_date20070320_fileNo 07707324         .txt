(&#147 Gray&#148 or the &#147 Company&#148 ) announced that it completed the refinancing of its senior credit facility. The principal terms of this new senior credit facility are summarized below.The new senior credit facility has a total credit commitment of $1.025 billion and consists of a $100 million revolving credit facility and a $925 million institutional term loan facility.The Company used the initial draw under the new senior credit facility, consisting of an $8 million draw on the revolving credit facility and a $610 million draw on the term loan facility to fund the payoff of all outstanding amounts under its former senior credit facility, to pay fees and expenses relating to the refinancing and for other general corporate purposes.The new senior credit facility allows the Company up to two additional draw requests under the term loan facility (subject to satisfaction of customary borrowing conditions) to (1) draw up to $275 million to redeem all of the Company&#146 s existing and currently outstanding 9.25% Senior Subordinate Notes due 2011 (the &#147 9.25% Notes&#148 ) and (2) draw up to $40 million to redeem all of the Company&#146 s Series C Preferred Stock plus in each instance pay applicable accrued interest and/or dividends on its existing and currently outstanding securities as of the draw date and related fees and expenses related to the refinancing and/or redemption transactions. If the respective redemption transactions have not been completed at specified dates during the second quarter of 2007, the corresponding commitments under the term loan facility will permanently reduce.The revolving facility matures on March 19, 2014 and the term loan facility matures on December 31, 2014. In addition, the term loan facility will require quarterly installments of principal repayments equal to 0.25% of the total commitment beginning March 31, 2008. No permanent reductions to the revolving credit facility commitment will be required prior to the final maturity date of that facility.Under the new senior credit facility, the Company, at its option, can choose to pay interest at a rate equal to the LIBOR rate plus a margin or at the lenders&#146 base rate, generally equal to the lenders&#146 prime rate, plus a margin. The applicable margin for the revolving credit facility varies based on the Company&#146 s leverage ratio as defined in the loan agreement.
