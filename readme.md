#Simple Distributed Search Engine

> This repository is for distributed programming project;

## Introduction

The search engine is mainly based on three parts (*expected*):
- **Web Crawler** based on python
- **Inverted Index** based on Hadoop MapReduce
- **Search Engine Frontend** based on flask-bootstrap

All original pages get by crawler are saved in HDFS, after MapReduce the index will be saved in mangodb.
