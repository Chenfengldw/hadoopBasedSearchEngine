On June 13, 2014 (the &#8220 Closing Date&#8221 ), Gray Television, Inc.

The New Credit Facility provides total commitments of $575.0 million, consisting of a $525.0 million term loan facility (the &#8220 Term Loan&#8221 ) and a $50.0 million revolving credit facility (the &#8220 Revolving Credit Facility&#8221 ). On the Closing Date, the Company borrowed $525.0 million under the Term Loan. Proceeds from borrowings under the Term Loan were used to repay all amounts outstanding under the Company&#8217 s prior senior credit facility, which was then amended and restated, to fund the cash purchase price to complete the Hoak Acquisition (defined below) and to pay related fees and expenses, as well as for general corporate purposes. Term Loan borrowings bear interest, at the option of the Company, at either the Base Rate (as defined below) plus 1.75%-2.0% or the London Interbank Offered Rate (&#8220 LIBOR&#8221 )plus 2.75%-3.0%, subject to a LIBOR floor of 0.75%, in each case based on a first lien leverage ratio test as set forth in the New Credit Facility (the &#8220 First Lien Ratio Test&#8221 ). The Term Loan also requires the Company to make quarterly principal repayments equal to 0.25% of the outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan beginning September 30, 2014. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest, at the option of the Company, based on the Base Rate plus 1.0%-1.5% or LIBOR plus 2.0% -2.5%, in each case based on the First Lien Ratio Test. Base Rate is defined as the greatest of (i) the administrative agent&#8217 s prime rate, (ii) the overnight federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (iii) one-month LIBOR plus 1.0%. The Company is required to pay a commitment fee on the average daily unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility, which rate may range from 0.375% to 0.50% on an annual basis, based on the First Lien Ratio Test. The Revolving Credit Facility matures on June 13, 2019 and the Term Loan matures on June 13, 2021. The Company&#8217 s obligations under the New Credit Facility are secured by substantially all of the assets, including real estate, of the Company and substantially all of its subsidiaries. In addition, substantially all of the Company&#8217 s subsidiaries are joint and several guarantors of those obligations and the Company&#8217 s ownership interests in those subsidiaries are pledged to collateralize its obligations under the New Credit Facility. The New Credit Facility contains affirmative and restrictive covenants that the Company must comply with, including (a) limitations on additional indebtedness, (b) limitations on liens, (c) limitations on the sale of assets, (d) limitations on guarantees, (e) limitations on investments and acquisitions, (f) limitations on the payment of dividends, payments on certain other debt and share repurchases, (g) limitations on mergers, and (h) at all times at which amounts are outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, maintenance of a total leverage ratio not to exceed certain maximum limits, as well as other customary covenants for credit facilities of this type. The Company has various relationships with Wells Fargo and Bank of America and their respective affiliates, including as agents and lenders under the Company&#8217 s prior credit facility. In addition, some of the other agents and the lenders under the New Credit Facility, or their respective affiliates, have had in the past, and may have, in the future, various relationships with the Company involving the provision of financial or other advisory services, including cash management, investment banking and brokerage services.
