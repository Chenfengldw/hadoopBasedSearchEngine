Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. Effective as of March 31, 2010, Gray Television, Inc. (the &#147 Company&#148 ), certain of its subsidiaries, the Lenders (as defined therein) party thereto, and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (as successor by merger to Wachovia Bank, National Association &#147 Wachovia&#148 ), as administrative agent, entered into a Second Amendment (the &#147 Amendment&#148 ) to that certain Credit Agreement, dated as of March 19, 2007, by and among the Company, certain subsidiaries thereof, the Lenders party thereto and Wachovia, as administrative agent (the &#147 Credit Agreement&#148 ). The Amendment provides for, among other things: (i) an increase in the maximum total net leverage ratio covenant under the Credit Agreement through March 30, 2011 and (ii) a potential issuance of capital stock and/or senior or subordinated debt securities, which could include securities with a second lien security interest (the &#147 Replacement Debt&#148 ). The Amendment also provides for a reduction in the revolving loan commitment under the senior credit facility from $50.0 million to $40.0 million. From March 31, 2010 until the date the Company completes an offering of Replacement Debt resulting in the repayment of not less than $200 million of our term loan outstanding under the Credit Agreement, (i) the Company is required to pay an annual incentive fee equal to 2.0%, which fee will be eliminated upon the consummation of such offering and repayment, (ii) the annual facility fee will remain at 3.0%, which fee will, following such repayment, be reduced to 1.25% per year, with a potential for further reductions in future periods, and (iii) the Company will remain subject to a maximum total net leverage ratio, which will, following such repayment, be replaced by a first lien leverage test, as described in the following paragraph. In addition, from and after such repayment, the Company will be required to comply with a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 0.90x to 1.0x. Upon the completion of an offering of Replacement Debt that results in the repayment of not less than $200 million of our term loan outstanding under the Credit Agreement, we will, from the date of such repayment, be subject to a maximum first lien leverage ratio covenant, which will replace our current maximum total leverage ratio covenant. The covenant will range from 7.5x to 6.5x, depending upon the amount of any such repayment. The use of proceeds from any issuance of Replacement Debt will generally be limited to the repayment of amounts outstanding under the term loan under the Credit Agreement and, in certain circumstances, to the repurchase of outstanding shares of the Company&#146 s Series D Perpetual Preferred Stock. We cannot provide any assurances that such a sale of Replacement Debt, or any repurchase of such preferred stock, will be completed by us, or of the terms or timing thereof. Beginning April 30, 2010 and thereafter, all interest and fees accrued under the Credit Agreement will be payable in cash upon their respective due dates, with no portion of such accrued interest and fees being subject to deferral. A summary of certain significant terms contained in our Credit Agreement (i) before the Amendment, (ii) as so amended, and (iii) as amended and after giving affect to a potential issuance of Replacement Debt and repayment of at least $200 million of term loans under the Credit Agreement, are summarized in the table below:Folio2/FolioPAGEBREAK Begin Table Head As Amended and After Giving Effect As Amended and to a Potential Prior to Potential Issuance of Issuance of Replacement Debt Prior to Replacement Debt and Related Amendment on and Related Repayment of TermDescription March 31, 2010 Repayment of Term Loan LoanEnd Table HeadBegin Table BodyBlank Space Annual interest rate on outstanding term loan balance LIBOR plus 3.5% Same Same or BASE plus 2.5% Blank Space Annual interest rate on outstanding revolving loan balance LIBOR plus 3.5% Same Same or BASE plus 2.5% Blank Space Annual facility fee rate 3% with a 3% with a 1.25% with a potential reduction potential reduction potential reduction in future periods. in future periods. in future periods.Blank Space Annual incentive fee rate 0.0% 2.0% 0.0%Blank Space Annual commitment fee on undrawn revolving loan balance 0.50% Same SameBlank Space Revolving loan commitment $50 million $40 million $40 millionBlank Space Maximum total net leverage ratio at: March 31, 2010 through June 29, 2010 7.00x 9.00x Replaced withJune 30, 2010 through September 29, 2010 6.50x 9.50x first lien leverageSeptember 30, 2010 through March 30, 2011 6.50x 9.75x test describedMarch 31, 2011 and thereafter 6.50x 6.50x above.Blank Space Minimum fixed charge coverage ratio None Same 0.90x to 1.0XBlank Space Maximum cash balance that can be deducted from total debt to calculate total net debt in the total net leverage ratio (or first lien leverage test, as applicable) $10.0 million Same $15.0 millionEnd Table Body As of December 31, 2009, we had a deferred loan cost balance of $1.6 million.
