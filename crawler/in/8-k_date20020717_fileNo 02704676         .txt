Other Events. In this report, unless otherwise indicated, the words &#147 Gray,&#148 &#147 our,&#148 &#147 us&#148 and &#147 we&#148 refer to Gray Communications Systems, Inc. and its subsidiaries. Our discussion of the television stations that we own and operate does not include our interest in the stations owned by Sarkes Tarzian, Inc. On June 4, 2002, we executed a merger agreement with Stations Holding Company, Inc., which we refer to as &#147 Stations,&#148 the parent company of Benedek Broadcasting Corporation, which we refer to as &#147 Benedek.&#148 The merger agreement provides that we will acquire Stations by merging our newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary, Gray MidAmerica Television, Inc., which we refer to as &#147 Gray MidAmerica Television,&#148 into Stations. In consideration for Stations, we will pay an estimated consideration of $502.5 million, a substantial portion of which will be used to satisfy, in full, certain outstanding indebtedness of Stations in accordance with a plan of reorganization filed by Stations with the United States bankruptcy court in Delaware on July 1, 2002. We may pay additional cash consideration of $4.9 million for certain estimated net working capital, as specified in the merger agreement. Benedek plans to sell or already has sold, prior to the effective time of the merger, a total of nine designated television stations. Upon completion of the merger, we will own a total of 28 stations serving 23 television markets. Based on results for the year ended December 31, 2001, the combined Gray and Benedek television stations produced approximately $213.9 million of net revenue and $84.8 million of broadcast cash flow. Including our publishing and other operations, the combined Gray and Benedek operations for 2001 produced approximately $263.8 million of net revenue and $97.1 million of media cash flow. We expect the merger, if it closes, to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2002. In connection with our acquisition of Stations, we intend to issue equity and debt securities, which may be effected through a registered offering or a private placement exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, and amend our existing credit facility.Insert HTML here1PAGEBREAK link1 "THE MERGER" Set forth below is certain business and financial information regarding Gray and Stations and information regarding our acquisition of Stations.THE MERGER This section of the report describes certain material aspects of the proposed merger. This summary does not contain all of the information that is important to you. You should carefully read the entire report and the other documents to which we refer you, including the merger agreement, for a more complete understanding of the merger.The Other Parties Stations is the parent company of Benedek. Stations&#146 principal executive offices are located at 2895 Greenpoint Parkway, Hoffman Estates, Illinois 60195, telephone number (847) 585-3450. Gray MidAmerica Television is our newly-formed wholly-owned subsidiary, formed solely for the purpose of effecting the merger.Our Reasons for the Merger Our business strategy includes continued acquisitions of companies whose businesses are complementary to ours. We believe that Stations is an excellent strategic fit and that the acquisition of Stations will create significant benefits, including: &#149 the acquisition will create a stronger company and will diversify the geographic range of our television stations, broadening substantially our market presence in the television broadcasting market &#149 the acquisition gives us access to additional operating cash flow for the purposes of funding debt service, as well as future acquisitions and investments &#149 the acquisition presents an opportunity to increase revenue share and audience share &#149 the acquisition presents an opportunity for cross-promotion and cross-selling and &#149 the acquisition strengthens our management teams and local news operations.Bankruptcy Court and Regulatory Filings and Approvals Bankruptcy Court.Stations has filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code. Consequently, the merger is subject to the bankruptcy court&#146 s approval of Stations&#146 plan of reorganization, and all of Stations&#146 obligations under the merger agreement are subject to the approval of the bankruptcy court. Stations filed the required information and materials with the bankruptcy court on July 1, 2002. Federal Communications Commission.The merger is subject to approval by the Federal Communications Commission, &#147 FCC.&#148 Stations and its subsidiaries and we and our subsidiaries filed with the FCC the necessary application with respect to the change of control on June 10, 2002. Antitrust.The merger is subject to the requirements of the Hart-Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, which provides that certain transactions may not be consummated until required information and materials have been furnished to the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission and certain waiting periods have expired or been terminated. Stations and we filed the required information and materials with the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission on June 20, 2002. Early termination of the statutory waiting period under the Hart-Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 was granted on July 1, 2002. The Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission frequently scrutinize the legality under the antitrust laws of transactions such as the merger. At any time before or after the effective time, either the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, or certain other persons could take action under the antitrust laws, including seeking to enjoin the merger.2PAGEBREAK Sale of Certain Designated Benedek Stations Prior to the Merger Benedek has sold or plans to sell, prior to the effective time of the merger, a total of nine designated television stations, which we refer to as the &#147 excluded stations.&#148 Benedek plans to sell eight of the excluded stations to Chelsey Broadcasting Company, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, which we refer to as &#147 Chelsey,&#148 or its affiliates pursuant to an asset purchase agreement. Benedek already has sold its television station in Wheeling, West Virginia to a third party on April 30, 2002. Benedek intends to use the net proceeds of these sales to repay indebtedness under its senior secured credit facility. The sale of the nine designated television stations is a condition to the merger.Accounting Treatment The merger will be accounted for as a purchase for financial accounting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. For purposes of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we will establish a new accounting basis for Stations&#146 assets and liabilities based upon their fair values, the merger consideration and the costs of the merger. Any excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets of Stations will be recorded as goodwill and other intangible assets. A final determination of the intangible asset values and required purchase accounting adjustments, including the allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values, has not yet been made. We will determine the fair value of Stations&#146 assets and liabilities and will make appropriate purchase accounting adjustments, including adjustments to the amortization period of the intangible assets, upon completion of that determination.3PAGEBREAK link1 "THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND RELATED AGREEMENTS"THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND RELATED AGREEMENTS This section of the report describes the material terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June 4, 2002, among Stations, Gray MidAmerica Television and us and related agreements, including the Lock Up, Voting and Consent Agreements that Stations and we entered into with certain stockholders and creditors of Stations, an agreement regarding benefits to be provided to members of the Benedek family following consummation of the merger and an amendment to K. James Yager&#146 s employment agreement. Copies of the merger agreement and lock up agreements are attached as exhibits to the report. You are urged to read the merger agreement in its entirety for a more complete description of the merger because it is the principal legal document that governs the merger.The Merger Subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, we will acquire Stations through the merger of Gray MidAmerica Television with and into Stations. Stations will be the surviving corporation in the merger.Effective Time The merger will be consummated when a certificate of merger, that we will file with the State of Delaware, becomes effective. The merger agreement provides that the parties will use their reasonable efforts to cause the effective time to occur on the seventh business day after the satisfaction or waiver of all the conditions to the merger. See &#147 The Merger Agreement and Related Agreements &#151 Conditions to the Merger.&#148 However, the effective time may not occur prior to October 1, 2002. The merger agreement further provides that we may, on one occasion, delay the effective time for up to 120 days if any of the following occurs: (1) any general suspension of trading in equity securities in the United States securities or financial markets for more than two consecutive trading days (2) a declaration of a banking moratorium or any suspension of payments in respect of banks by federal or state authorities in the United States (3) commencement of a war, armed hostilities or other national or international calamity directly involving the United States (4) any limitation by any governmental authority on the extension of credit by banks or other lending institutions in the United States or (5) if any of the foregoing exists on the date the merger agreement is signed, a material acceleration or worsening thereof.Merger Consideration and Conversion of Gray MidAmerica Television and Stations&#146 Stock At the effective time of the merger, the outstanding shares of Stations 11.5% Senior Exchangeable Preferred Stock, which we refer to as the &#147 senior preferred stock,&#148 and Junior Discount Preferred Stock, which we refer to as the &#147 junior preferred stock,&#148 will be converted into the right to receive a cash payment. No cash consideration will be paid to holders of outstanding shares of Stations class A common stock and class B common stock. The stock of Gray MidAmerica Television and Stations will be converted as described below: Gray MidAmerica Television common stock.Each share of Gray MidAmerica Television common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be converted into one share of Stations class B common stock. Stations senior preferred stock.Each share of Stations senior preferred stock (excluding shares held by Stations or any of its subsidiaries, other than in a fiduciary capacity) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be converted into the right to receive the senior preferred stock purchase price, equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (1) $500,000,000,minus(A) the amount outstanding at the effective time under Stations debt instruments plus accrued interest thereon through the effective time, determined in accordance with Stations&#146 plan of reorganization,plus or minus(B) working capital adjustments and adjustments relating to amounts incurred by Stations and its subsidiaries with4PAGEBREAK respect to the conversion of their television stations to digital broadcasting by (2) 100,000 (the number of outstanding shares of Stations&#146 senior preferred stock at the effective time). Stations junior preferred stock.Each share of Stations junior preferred stock (excluding shares held by Stations or any of the Stations subsidiaries, other than in a fiduciary capacity) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (1) $2,500,000 by (2) 450,000 (the number of outstanding shares of Stations junior preferred stock at the effective time). Stations class A common stock and class B common stock.Each share of Stations class A common stock and class B common stock and any options or warrants to acquire such shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be cancelled. We will not pay any cash consideration for such securities.The Letter of Credit and the Escrow Shares When the merger agreement was signed, we delivered to Stations a standby letter of credit in the amount of $12.5 million and deposited with SunTrust Bank, as escrow agent, 885,269 shares of our class B common stock. These escrow shares had an aggregate value of $12.5 million, based on the average price of our class B common stock for the 20 consecutive trading days on the New York Stock Exchange ending on June 2, 2002. The escrow shares are being held by the escrow agent in accordance with the terms of an escrow agreement that we executed on June 4, 2002. We will maintain the letter of credit in effect, and the escrow shares will remain in escrow, until the earlier of the effective time or 10 business days after the termination of the merger agreement. If the letter of credit or any replacement letter of credit expires before either of the dates described in the previous sentence, we will renew the letter of credit or obtain a replacement letter of credit, which we will deliver to Stations at least five business days before such expiration. If the merger is not consummated because of a material default by us, and Stations has not materially defaulted due to a breach of any of its representations or warranties or any of its covenants or agreements under the merger agreement, then Stations may draw on the letter of credit and instruct the escrow agent to deliver to it the escrow shares pursuant to the escrow agreement. We have an obligation to deliver a letter of credit and escrow shares totaling $25 million, except that we may, in our sole discretion, replace some or all of the escrow shares with a cash payment, so long as any such cash payment is a whole number multiple of $500,000. Under specified circumstances, if Stations is entitled to receive the escrow shares and the value of the escrow shares decreases to below $12.5 million at the time Stations sells them, we may be required to pay to Stations the amount of such decrease. Likewise, if the value of the escrow shares increases, Stations may be required to pay to us the amount of such increase. At the effective time and subject to the conditions in the merger agreement and the escrow agreement, the letter of credit and the escrow shares will be returned to us.Registration of the Escrow Shares The escrow shares have not been registered under the Securities Act or any other applicable securities laws, and therefore are restricted securities. If the merger agreement is terminated and the escrow shares are delivered by the escrow agent to Stations, we are required to: &#149 file with the SEC a registration statement with respect to the resale or distribution of the escrow shares by Stations and/or an affiliate of Stations, within 30 days after such termination &#149 use our best efforts to cause the registration statement to be declared effective at the earliest practicable time &#149 keep the registration statement effective and current until the earlier of six months following the effectiveness of the registration statement or the date that all of the escrow shares covered by the registration statement have been sold or distributed 5PAGEBREAK &#149 cause the escrow shares to be listed promptly with the New York Stock Exchange and &#149 indemnify, to the extent permitted by law, each person selling or distributing securities under the registration statement, and related parties, against all losses caused by any material misstatement or omission by us in the registration statement or any violation by us of the Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, any state securities laws or any rules or regulations of the New York Stock Exchange.Conditions to the Merger The parties&#146 obligations to consummate the merger and related transactions generally are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the following conditions: &#149 the bankruptcy court approving the order confirming Stations&#146 plan of reorganization and such confirmation order becoming a final bankruptcy court order &#149 the FCC approving the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, without any condition or qualification materially adverse to us or our subsidiaries or Stations or its subsidiaries, or materially adverse to our acquisition of control of Stations and its subsidiaries &#149 all regulatory waiting periods applicable to the merger agreement and the related transactions expiring or terminating &#149 no order being in effect enjoining, restraining or prohibiting the consummation of the merger and related transactions and no action or proceeding having been instituted by any regulatory authority seeking any such order that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on us or on Stations and &#149 the transactions related to the Chelsey purchase agreement being consummated, unless the failure to consummate such transactions is the result of either the wrongful refusal of Chelsey to consummate such transactions or the election by Chelsey not to consummate the transactions because Benedek failed to satisfy certain conditions set forth in the Chelsey purchase agreement. If the transactions contemplated by the Chelsey purchase agreement are not consummated as a result of FCC action or inaction, Stations and we each agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, everything reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and the Chelsey purchase agreement at the earliest practicable date. Our obligations to consummate the merger and related transactions are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the following additional conditions: &#149 the representations and warranties made by Stations in the merger agreement being, subject to limited exceptions, correct and complete in all material respects at the effective time &#149 each and all of the agreements and covenants of Stations and each of its subsidiaries under the merger agreement and related agreements being performed and complied with in all material respects prior to the effective time &#149 our receiving from Stations customary officer certificates and board of directors resolutions relating to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement &#149 our receiving a legal opinion of FCC counsel to Stations &#149 Stations returning to us the letter of credit &#149 the FCC issuing a final FCC order approving the transfer of control of Benedek&#146 s television licenses to us 6PAGEBREAK &#149 Stations obtaining and delivering to us consents or waivers relating to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, as required by its network affiliation agreements and &#149 no litigation being pending or threatened involving Stations or any its subsidiaries that would have, or reasonably be expected to have, a material adverse effect on Stations or its subsidiaries or their respective businesses or assets. The obligations of Stations to consummate the merger and related transactions are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the following additional conditions: &#149 the representations and warranties made by us and Gray MidAmerica Television in the merger agreement being, subject to limited exceptions, correct and complete in all material respects at the effective time &#149 each of our and Gray MidAmerica Television&#146 s agreements and covenants under the merger agreement and related agreements being performed and complied with in all material respects prior to the effective time and &#149 Stations receiving from us and Gray MidAmerica Television customary officer certificates and board of directors resolutions relating to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.Representations and Warranties In the merger agreement, Stations makes customary representations and warranties about itself and its business, including representations and warranties about: &#149 organization, good standing and corporate power &#149 authorization and enforceability of the merger agreement &#149 capitalization and subsidiaries &#149 financial statements and tax matters and &#149 absence of undisclosed liabilities or material adverse changes. In addition, Stations makes numerous representations and warranties with respect to its assets, real property, intellectual property, computer software and databases, accounts receivable, insurance, bonds, letters of credit and guarantees, compliance with law, environmental matters, litigation and claims, benefit plans, contracts, labor matters, brokers and finders, interested transactions, officers, directors and bank accounts and the absence of any material misstatement or omission by it in the merger agreement.

We also make representations with respect to our qualification under the Telecommunications Act of 1966 to enter into and consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, our filings with the SEC and our issuance of the escrow shares.Mutual Covenants of Gray and Stations Subject to limited exceptions and except for the sale of the excluded stations by Benedek to Chelsey, from June 4, 2002 until the closing of the merger or the termination of the merger agreement, Stations and we will, and will cause each of our respective subsidiaries, to: &#149 operate our respective businesses only in the usual, regular, and ordinary course &#149 use commercially reasonable efforts to preserve intact our respective business organizations and assets and maintain our respective rights and franchises and7PAGEBREAK &#149 take no action that would materially adversely affect the ability of any party to (1) obtain any consents required for the transactions contemplated in the merger agreement, or (2) perform its covenants and agreements under the merger agreement in all material respects and to consummate the merger and to satisfy the conditions to closing set forth in the merger agreement. However, the covenant described in clause (2) above will not prohibit us or any of our subsidiaries from discontinuing or disposing of any of our assets or businesses, or, provided that we do not materially adversely affect our ability to obtain an FCC order approving the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, from acquiring or agreeing to acquire any other person or their assets if such action is, in our judgment, desirable in the conduct of our business or our subsidiaries&#146 business. Additional Covenants.The merger agreement also contains other covenants made by us and Stations, including a covenant to file all necessary FCC applications for approval of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and a covenant to use reasonable efforts to take all actions and to do all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the merger as promptly as practicable but not before October 1, 2002.Covenants of Stations The merger agreement contains numerous covenants of Stations that are customary for this type of transaction. Among other things, subject to limited exceptions, Stations and its subsidiaries will not do or agree to do any of the following without our prior written consent, which we will not withhold unreasonably: &#149 amend the organizational documents of Stations or of any of its subsidiaries &#149 incur, guarantee or otherwise become responsible for any new debt obligation or other obligation

any material change in or to any existing employee benefit plans or programs of Stations or any of its subsidiaries &#149 make any significant change in any accounting methods, principles, or practices or systems of internal accounting controls, except as may be necessary to conform to changes in regulatory accounting requirements or generally accepted accounting principles &#149 settle any material litigation other than in accordance with past practice or to the extent it is covered by insurance &#149 except in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices, enter into or terminate any material contract or make any material change in any contract &#149 fail to promptly notify us of any inquiry, investigation, or proceeding related to any of Stations&#146 television stations that is initiated by the FCC and &#149 request the bankruptcy court to take any action or to grant any approval to any action or matter that is in any way inconsistent with the merger agreement.8PAGEBREAK Indemnification For a period of six years after the effective time of the merger, we will indemnify the pre-merger directors, officers, employees and agents of Stations and its subsidiaries against all liabilities arising out of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the effective time arising out of their service as directors, officers, employees or agents of Stations, any of its subsidiaries or, at Stations&#146 or any of its subsidiaries&#146 request, another entity, to the fullest extent permitted under Delaware law, by Stations&#146 or its subsidiaries&#146 certificates of incorporation and bylaws and by any applicable indemnification agreements.Termination of the Merger Agreement The merger agreement generally may be terminated at any time prior to the effective time by the mutual consent of Gray and Stations or by us or Stations: &#149 if the terminating party is not then in material breach of any of its representations or warranties or any of its covenants contained in the merger agreement, in the event of the inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of the non-terminating party contained in the merger agreement which would reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on the non-terminating party and cannot be or has not been cured within 30 days after written notice of such inaccuracy is given to the non-terminating party &#149 if the terminating party is not then in material breach of any of its representations or warranties or any of its covenants contained in the merger agreement, in the event of a material breach by the non-terminating party of any covenant or agreement contained in the merger agreement that cannot be or has not been cured within 30 days after written notice of such breach is given to the non-terminating party, except that we may not cure any breach of our obligation to pay the merger consideration &#149 if the merger is not consummated by March 31, 2003, in each case only if the failure to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement on or before such date is not caused by any material breach of the merger agreement by the terminating party, except that the March 31, 2003 termination date automatically will be extended by one day for each day that the closing does not occur because, subject to certain exceptions, the transactions contemplated by the Chelsey purchase agreement are not consummated or &#149 if it is reasonably anticipated that any of the conditions precedent to the obligations of the terminating party to consummate the merger, other than the condition that, subject to certain exceptions, the transactions contemplated by the Chelsey purchase agreement are consummated, cannot be satisfied or fulfilled by March 31, 2003 and such failure was not the fault of the terminating party.Effects of Termination If the merger agreement is terminated, as described above, it will become void and have no effect. However, certain provisions of the merger agreement will survive termination, including provisions relating to the letter of credit and the escrow shares, confidentiality and expenses. In addition, in the event that the merger agreement is terminated by us or by Stations in connection with any material breach of any representation or warranty or any covenant or other agreement of the other party contained in the merger agreement or because the merger is not consummated prior to the applicable termination date, the breaching party will remain liable for any uncured breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement giving rise to such termination. If the closing does not occur due to a material default by us, and Stations has not materially defaulted due to a breach of any of its representations or warranties or any of its covenants or agreements under the merger agreement, then Stations may draw on the letter of credit and instruct the escrow agent to deliver to it the escrow shares pursuant to the escrow agreement. The aggregate proceeds of the drawing on the letter of credit and the escrow shares will total $25 million, but we may replace some or all of the9PAGEBREAK escrow shares with a cash payment so long as any such cash payment is a whole number multiple of $500,000. If the closing does not occur due to the non-fulfillment of any of the conditions precedent to each party&#146 s obligation to consummate the merger, and we are not in material default in the performance of any of our representations or warranties or any of our covenants or agreements under the merger agreement, Stations will not be entitled to the letter of credit or the escrow shares and, after termination of the merger agreement, the letter of credit and the escrow shares will be returned to us.Waivers Prior to or at the effective time, we and Stations may waive any material default in the performance of any term of the merger agreement by the other party or any of its subsidiaries, waive or extend the time for the compliance or fulfillment by the other party and its subsidiaries of any and all of their obligations under the merger agreement, and waive any or all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of the other party and its subsidiaries under the merger agreement. However, neither we nor Stations may waive any condition which, if not satisfied, would result in the material violation of any law.Fees and Expenses Generally, regardless of whether the merger is consummated, Stations will be responsible for all expenses and fees incurred by it and its subsidiaries in connection with the merger and we will be responsible for all expenses and costs incurred by us in connection with the merger. However, we will pay all the fees related to the filings with the FTC. Also, Stations and we will each pay one-half of the processing fees related to the filing with the FCC of applications regarding the transfer of control of Benedek&#146 s television licenses to us.Lock Up Agreements On June 4, 2002, in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, Stations and we entered into the lock up agreements with certain stockholders and creditors of Stations, whom we refer to as the &#147 consenting stockholders and creditors.&#148 Under these lock up agreements, the consenting stockholders and creditors agreed to, among other things, support and vote their shares in favor of a Stations bankruptcy plan that will give effect to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Stations has received executed lock up agreements from holders of 97.9% of the outstanding senior preferred stock, 98.8% of the outstanding junior preferred stock, 100% of the outstanding class B common stock, and 94.6% of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the senior subordinated discount notes. In addition, consenting stockholders that hold Stations senior preferred stock have agreed to pay to us, if Stations receives certain superior proposals relating to an acquisition of Stations by a third party and such superior proposal is approved by the bankruptcy court, contemporaneously with the transaction contemplated by such superior proposal, a termination fee of $15 million. The liability of each consenting stockholder that holds Stations senior preferred stock is limited to an amount determined by multiplying $15 million by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of senior preferred stock owned by such consenting stockholder and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Stations senior preferred stock owned by all consenting stockholders.Benedek Family Benefits Agreement On May 29, 2002, in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, we entered into a letter agreement with A. Richard Benedek, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Stations, Laura Benedek, Richard Benedek&#146 s wife, and Stephen D. Benedek, a Vice President of Stations and Richard Benedek&#146 s son, in which we agreed to provide to them, following consummation of the merger, certain health and welfare benefits, use of office space in New York City until no later than August 31, 2005, and severance benefits of up to $275,000. In addition, we may be required to forgive certain indebtedness owed by Richard Benedek to Stations. Upon the closing of the merger, we will cease10PAGEBREAK the use of the name &#147 Benedek Broadcasting,&#148 the &#147 Benedek.com&#148 URL and the name &#147 Benedek Interactive Media.&#148 The right to use the &#147 Benedek Broadcasting&#148 name will be conveyed, at no cost, to Richard Benedek and the right to use the &#147 Benedek.com&#148 URL and the name &#147 Benedek Interactive Media&#148 will be conveyed, at no cost, to Stephen Benedek.K. James Yager Employment Agreement On June 4, 2002, Benedek and K. James Yager, Benedek&#146 s President and Chief Operating Officer, entered into a second amendment to K. James Yager&#146 s employment agreement, which will become effective only upon consummation of the merger. In addition, we entered into a letter agreement with K. James Yager relating to this amendment. K. James Yager&#146 s employment agreement is for a term of four years commencing on January 1, 2001 and ending on December 31, 2004, the &#147 expiration date.&#148 K. James Yager&#146 s base salary is $630,000 for 2001 and $680,000 for 2002 and thereafter increases to a per annum rate not less than 105% of his base salary during the preceding year. K. James Yager is eligible to receive a bonus in respect of each fiscal year during the term of the agreement in such amount as Benedek may determine. The agreement also entitles K. James Yager to specified fringe benefits and to participation in employee benefit plans generally available to Benedek&#146 s executives. In addition, Benedek has agreed to pay to K. James Yager the amount necessary, on an after-tax basis, to discharge all amounts, including accrued interest, owed by him to Benedek under his $555,000 promissory note. If Benedek terminates K. James Yager&#146 s employment without cause, or if K. James Yager terminates his employment by reason of a &#147 constructive discharge,&#148 which includes the assignment to K. James Yager of duties or reporting responsibilities inconsistent in any material respect with his status, title, position or duties or any breach by Benedek of his employment agreement, K. James Yager will be entitled to receive his base salary, and to participate, at no cost to him, in all employee benefits, through the expiration date and his non-competition obligations will be terminated. In our letter agreement with K. James Yager, we agreed that our failure to employ him as President and Chief Operating Officer of our broadcast division or subsidiary within 12 months after the consummation of the merger would constitute a constructive discharge, entitling him to the above benefits. Our letter agreement with K. James Yager also provides that, after consummation of the merger, we will grant to him nonqualified options to purchase shares of our class B common stock pursuant to the terms of our long term incentive plan. The number of shares subject to the option award will be determined by our board of directors, and the exercise price of the option shares will be the market price of our class B common stock at the time the award is granted. The options will vest ratably over the term of K. James Yager&#146 s employment agreement, with vesting to be accelerated in the event of a constructive discharge.Bull Run Advisory Fee For advisory services rendered by Bull Run in connection with the merger, we paid to Bull Run an advisory fee of $5,000,000 on June 10, 2002. This advisory fee must be repaid to us if the merger is not completed.11PAGEBREAK INFORMATION REGARDING GRAYOperating &#38 Growth Strategy We attribute our success to date and our current opportunities to increase our revenue, media cash flow and audience share to the successful implementation of our core operating strategies, the principal components of which are to: &#149 Focus on Local News and Programming to Maintain a Strong Local Franchise.We operate, or will operate after completion of the merger with Stations, 28 network affiliated television stations serving 23 markets, with 24 of our 28 stations ranked first or second in local news. We endeavor to make each of our television stations a highly recognizable, local brand through the depth, quality and focus of its local news, programming and community involvement. We believe that providing the leading source for local news and programming in our markets enables us to strengthen audience loyalty and increase viewership among attractive demographic audiences. As a result, we believe that the strength of our local franchises enables us to maximize advertising revenues from local, regional and national accounts. We believe that our commitment to local news, programming and community involvement is essential to our ability to serve each of the communities in which we operate and provides us with a strong competitive advantage. &#149 Continue to Develop Innovative Local Sales and Targeted Marketing Initiatives.We employ an experienced, high-quality local sales force at each station to increase advertising revenue by leveraging our local brand. In 2001, pro forma for the proposed merger with Stations, approximately 60% of our net television advertising revenue was generated from our local advertisers. Additionally, our net revenue from local television advertisers represented approximately 67% of the combined total of our local and national net advertising revenues. Our goal is to develop customized advertising campaigns for our customers, which directly target their desired audience and address their long-term advertising objectives. We believe that a focused, tailored advertising solution is very attractive to local advertisers, who have historically been a more stable source of revenue than national advertisers. In addition to focusing on expanding our relationships with existing advertisers, we seek to identify and create new relationships with local, regional and national customers in our markets. Each station&#146 s sales personnel are trained to understand local advertisers&#146 needs and are required to meet performance standards with respect to client activity, including new customer identification. &#149 Capitalize on Leading Network Brands in Markets with Limited Competition.We have, or will have after completion of the merger with Stations, a broad and diverse portfolio of 28 affiliated television stations located in 23 markets, of which 15 are affiliated with CBS, seven are affiliated with NBC and six are affiliated with ABC affiliates, representing approximately 56%, 29%, and 15% of our total pro forma net television revenue in 2001, respectively. Additionally, we will be the largest independent owner of CBS affiliated television stations. Our network affiliations provide our television stations with top-rated programming, which complements and enhances our leading local brand. We believe that our markets are less competitive than larger designated market areas, &#147 DMAs.&#148 Of our 24 markets (including Hazard, Kentucky as a separate market), 16 markets are served by four TV stations or fewer, and seven markets are served by three or fewer television stations. Our markets also typically have fewer radio stations than larger DMAs. &#149 Pursue Strategic Acquisitions to Expand and Enhance Our Regional Clusters.We have acquired and integrated successfully 12 of our 13 television stations since 1993, and have signed a definitive12PAGEBREAK agreement to acquire an additional 15 television stations from Stations. After giving effect to the proposed merger, our television stations are located in several distinct regions throughout the United States, with significant presence in the Southeast, Midwest, Texas and Great Lakes region, diminishing any potential adverse effect on our business caused by specific regional economic fluctuations. We believe that we are well positioned to participate in further consolidation of our industry, including opportunities that may arise as a result of future regulatory changes. For example, a number of the FCC&#146 s most restrictive ownership regulations, including newspaper-television cross ownership and television duopoly rules, are currently under review and could be relaxed in the future, providing us with further attractive growth opportunities. In pursuing future acquisitions, we intend to focus on network affiliated television stations in medium-sized markets that offer superior growth. Specifically, we pursue television stations proximate to our existing clusters, as evidenced by the proposed merger with Stations in which five of the 15 television stations we intend to acquire are adjacent to markets in which we currently own and operate television stations. Additionally, we focus on acquiring television stations where we can successfully implement our operating strategies to establish leading local news, increase revenue and audience share, develop relevant regional content and reduce costs. &#149 Attract and Retain High-Quality Management.We believe that high-quality management at both the corporate and station level is critical to the successful implementation of our strategy. We use equity incentives to attract and retain station general managers with proven track records. Members of our senior management team have extensive experience in operating, managing and acquiring television stations, and include: J. Mack Robinson, President and Chief Executive Officer Robert Prather, Executive Vice President - Acquisitions James Ryan, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and after the proposed merger, K. James Yager, currently the President of Benedek. &#149 Maintain Strict Financial Planning and Cost Controls.We employ a comprehensive ongoing strategic planning and budgeting process that enables us to continually identify and implement cost savings at each station, and is designed to increase our media cash flow. Owning and operating 28 television stations will enable us to achieve economies of scale and reduce expenses for syndicated programming, capital equipment and vendor services. Furthermore, we believe that the synergies generated through geographic clustering, further enhanced by the Stations acquisition and the realization of technological and automation efficiencies, will enable us to achieve additional cost savings in the near future. &#149 Increase Advertising Revenue and Circulation at Our Newspaper Publishing Operations.We seek to increase advertising revenues and circulation at each of our four newspapers by creating a highly recognizable local brand by focusing on the depth and quality of our coverage of local news, sports and lifestyles and through community involvement. We are able to differentiate our publications from larger competitors and build reader loyalty by becoming the primary source for local news and advertising information within each of our target markets. We also sponsor community events with the objective of strengthening our community relationships. We employ an experienced local sales force to increase advertising revenue by leveraging our local brand. Through our ongoing strategic planning and budgeting process, we continually identify and implement cost savings at each newspaper to increase our media cash flow. In 2001, publishing represented approximately 16% of our total pro forma net revenue. Our publishing management team has extensive experience in operating, managing and acquiring newspapers and is led by Thomas J. Stultz, Vice President and President of Publishing, who has 32 years of publishing industry experience.13PAGEBREAK link1 "SELECTED STATION AND MARKET INFORMATION REGARDING GRAY AND STATIONS"SELECTED STATION AND MARKET INFORMATION REGARDING GRAY AND STATIONSGray Television Stations Pro Forma Following the Merger The following is a list of all our stations pro forma following the merger.

These television stations are geographically diverse and serve small to medium-sized markets in 11 states. Five of the stations are affiliated with CBS, six are affiliated with ABC, and four are affiliated with NBC. All of the data included in this section relates solely to the stations that we plan to acquire in the merger. The stations are located in DMAs ranked in size from 65 to 186 out of the 210 DMAs surveyed by A. C. Nielsen Company. The broadcast signals for these stations that we intend to acquire in the merger reach approximately 2.6 million television households, representing approximately 2.5% of all television households in the United States. Stations believes that broadcast television stations in small to medium-sized markets offer an opportunity to generate attractive and stable broadcasting cash flow due to limited competition from: &#149 other television stations for viewers &#149 other media soliciting advertising expenditures and &#149 other television stations purchasing syndicated programming. Stations operates in markets that typically have stable employment and a diverse base of employers. Stations generally targets markets that have population centers that share common community interests and are receptive to local programming. Stations&#146 local programming and news content coupled with its network affiliations provide each of its stations with an established audience and reputation for news, sports and entertainment programming. Stations&#146 senior management team, led by K. James Yager, President and Chief Operating Officer, has extensive experience in acquiring and improving the operations of television stations. In addition, Stations&#146 stations are supported by a team of senior vice presidents who directly oversee the day-to-day operations of the business. Louis S. Wall and Christopher H. Cornelius manage seven and six of the stations, respectively. These executives have an average of 22 years of experience operating and managing broadcast television stations. Stations selectively purchases first run and off-network syndicated programming designed to reach specific demographic groups attractive to advertisers. Currently, Stations broadcasts on many of its stations the five most highly-rated syndicated programs. These programs and the number of stations on which they are broadcast are: &#149 &#147 Wheel of Fortune&#148 on nine of its stations &#149 &#147 Jeopardy&#148 on seven of its stations &#149 &#147 Seinfeld&#148 on seven of its stations and &#149 &#147 Entertainment Tonight&#148 on seven of its stations. Additionally, Stations broadcasts other highly-rated first run and off-network syndicated programs on its stations including: &#149 &#147 Judge Judy &#148 &#149 &#147 The Oprah Winfrey Show &#148 &#149 &#147 Everybody Loves Raymond &#148 &#149 &#147 Live! with Regis and Kelly &#148 and &#149 &#147 Frasier.&#148 28PAGEBREAK Stations seeks to acquire syndicated programs that: &#149 have wide audience appeal &#149 are available on a cost-effective basis for limited licensing periods &#149 allow scheduling flexibility &#149 complement each station&#146 s overall programming mix and &#149 counter competitive programming. Stations has been able to purchase syndicated programming at attractive rates because of the limited competition from other television broadcasters for such programming in its markets. As a result, Stations&#146 cash program expense as a percentage of net revenues for its stations was 4.4% in 1999, 4.7% in 2000 and 5.5% in 2001. In comparison, according to the 2001 Television Financial Report published by the National Association of Broadcasters, the percentage of net revenues spent for programming by all network affiliated stations was 8.8% in 1999 and 8.2% in 2000.Background Stations was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on April 10, 1996. Stations&#146 corporate name was changed from Benedek Communications Corporation to Stations Holding Company, Inc. effective February 1, 2002. Benedek was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on January 22, 1979. The principal executive offices of Stations is located at 2895 Greenspoint Parkway, Suite 250, Hoffman Estates, Illinois 60195. The telephone number at the executive offices is (847) 585-3450.Network Affiliation of Stations&#146 Television Stations Each of the television stations we are acquiring is affiliated with either CBS, ABC or NBC. Each affiliation agreement provides the station with the right to broadcast all programs transmitted by the network. In return, the network has the right to sell a substantial majority of the advertising time during network programming. In exchange for every hour that a station elects to broadcast network programming, CBS, ABC and NBC have historically paid the station a specified fee. This fee varies with the time of day. Typically, prime-time programming generates the highest hourly rates. Fees are subject to increase or decrease by the network during the term of an affiliation agreement, with provisions for advance notices and the right of termination by the station in the event of a reduction of rates. During 1999, each of the major networks publicly indicated that it was reviewing the economic and other terms under which it provides programming to network affiliates like our stations. Proposed changes that have been publicly discussed include: &#149 reducing the period of exclusivity with respect to popular programming &#149 changing the amount and placement of advertising time made available for sale by affiliates during network programming and &#149 requiring affiliates to share part of the costs of producing sports or special programming. These changes may be implemented during the term of existing affiliation agreements or upon their renewal. Additionally, the major networks have proposed reducing or eliminating the cash payments paid by networks to affiliates at the time of renewal of existing affiliation agreements. Stations&#146 NBC affiliation agreements for WOWT, WMTV, WILX and WTAP were renegotiated effective as of January 1, 2002 and the agreements were extended to January 1, 2012. As a result of these negotiations compensation for WOWT, WMTV, WILX and WTAP continues although at a reduced level through 2005. For the period from January 1, 2006 through the expiration of the contract on January 1, 2012, the agreements do not provide for any network compensation payments.29PAGEBREAK Stations&#146 ABC affiliation agreements for WBKO, WHSV and WTOK expire on November 1, 2004 and provide for compensation that decreases throughout the term of the contract and reduces to zero by the expiration date of the contract. In response to declining revenues, some networks have suggested that they may search for alternative methods of distribution for their programming, such as cable channels.Advertising Sales Television station revenues are derived primarily from local, regional and national advertising. Stations seeks to manage its spot inventory efficiently to maximize advertising rates. Advertising rates are based upon numerous factors including: &#149 a program&#146 s popularity among the audience &#149 the number of advertisers competing for the available time allotted to commercials &#149 the size and demographic make-up of the audience and &#149 the availability of alternative advertising media in the market area. In March 2000, Stations restructured the organization of its local sales departments to place a greater emphasis on local and regional advertising sales. Stations shifted certain local advertising accounts to national representatives to better reflect the actual source of revenues. As a result of the restructuring and its new philosophy, period-to-period comparisons of trends in Stations&#146 local/regional and national sales will be difficult for you to make. Local Sales.Approximately 60% of Stations&#146 gross revenues in 2001 came from local and regional advertisers. Local and regional advertising is sold primarily by each station&#146 s professional sales staff. Typical local and regional advertisers include: &#149 automobile dealerships &#149 restaurants &#149 retailers &#149 communications companies &#149 grocery chains &#149 soft drink bottlers &#149 health and medical services and &#149 state lotteries. Stations seeks to establish long term relationships with local advertisers by selling its advertising time through dedicated local sales teams. Stations&#146 goal is to provide local customers the opportunity to communicate their longer term advertising goals so it can develop strategic advertising campaigns for them. In addition to increasing revenues from existing advertisers, Stations seeks to identify new sources of local advertising revenues. In particular, Stations seeks potential advertisers who have not previously advertised on broadcast television, but whose businesses would benefit from the identity of Stations&#146 local news and programming. Stations&#146 sales personnel are required to meet minimum weekly and monthly performance standards with respect to client activity, including new customer identification. Stations also offers commercial production services at each of its stations. National Sales.Approximately 31% of Stations&#146 gross revenues in 2001 came from national advertisers. Typical national advertisers include: &#149 automobile manufacturers &#149 consumer goods manufacturers 30PAGEBREAK &#149 communications companies &#149 fast food franchisers &#149 national retailers and &#149 direct marketers. National advertising time is sold through representative agencies retained by Stations. Two of the television stations we are acquiring are represented by Petry Television, Inc., ten are represented by Katz Television Sales, and one is represented by Blair Television. These stations&#146 national sales coordinators actively assist their national sales representatives to induce national advertisers to increase their national spot expenditures designated to our markets. Political Sales.Political advertising revenues are a significant factor in Stations business during election years. Local and regional elections, which can include gubernatorial, U.S. senatorial and congressional races, generally occur every even numbered year. National presidential elections occur every four years. In 2000 and 1998, Stations had political advertising revenues of $13.3 million and $8.6 million, respectively, at its stations we are acquiring pursuant to the merger representing approximately 10% and 7% of such stations&#146 gross revenues during such years.Implementation of the Cable Act of 1992 The Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992, the &#147 Cable Act,&#148 was enacted on October 5, 1992. The Cable Act: &#149 imposes cable rate regulation &#149 establishes cable ownership limitations &#149 regulates the relationships between cable operators and their program suppliers &#149 regulates signal carriage and retransmission consent and &#149 regulates numerous other aspects of the cable television business. Stations has entered into agreements for its stations with substantially all of the cable system operators that carry our stations&#146 signals. All of these agreements grant such cable system operators consent to retransmit Stations&#146 broadcast signals. These retransmission arrangements do not represent a significant source of revenues for Stations. Stations expects to be able to renew its current retransmission agreements when such agreements expire. However, there can be no assurance that such renewals will be obtained.Digital Operations The FCC had required that all of the stations owned by Stations commence digital operations by May 1, 2002. Stations has incurred approximately $4.5 million in capital expenditures towards its digital conversion of the stations we are acquiring as a result of the merger, and it anticipates incurring additional capital expenditures of $6.8 million in the balance of 2002 and thereafter with respect to such stations. In order to accommodate the conversion to digital and maintain our historical capital expenditure levels, Stations has reduced its plans for the other non-essential capital expenditures in 2002. Stations anticipates that such expenditures will be paid for through cash generated from operations. One of the stations owned by Stations had commenced digital operations by May 1, 2002. The FCC had implemented a process to allow broadcast companies to request an extension of time to complete the build-out to digital. On March 4, 2002, Stations filed extension requests with respect to its stations that have not been converted to digital. Stations was granted extensions covering the period May 1, 2002 through various dates in November 2002. We cannot assure you that Stations will be able to complete the construction of all of its DTV stations by the applicable FCC deadlines. If Stations is unable to meet31PAGEBREAK applicable build-out deadlines or obtain additional extensions, Stations may be subject to FCC sanctions, including the loss of the authorization to construct the DTV station.Employees As of May 31, 2002, Stations had 807 full-time employees at the stations we are acquiring as a result of the merger. Approximately 172 of such employees located at three of such stations are represented by labor unions under collective bargaining agreements. The collective bargaining agreements expire at various times from June 2003 through December 2003. At WIFR-TV, Rockford, Illinois, 23 employees have certified a union and negotiations for a collective bargaining agreement are scheduled to occur shortly. There are no unionized employees at the other stations we are acquiring as a result of the merger. Stations believes that its relationship with all of its employees, including those represented by labor unions, is satisfactory.Properties The principal executive offices of Stations is located in leased premises in Hoffman Estates, Illinois. Stations also has executive offices in New York City. The types of properties required to support the television stations which Gray is acquiring as a result of the merger include offices, studios, and tower and transmitter sites.

(e)Stations has an option to purchase this property during the term of the lease. The purchase price is subject to adjustment depending upon the date the option is exercised. If Stations had exercised the option on December 31, 2001, the purchase price would have been approximately $1.4 million. (f)The United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service granted us a Special Use Permit to occupy this land. Stations has applied for and is currently awaiting renewal of this permit. (g)In May 2000, Stations exercised a purchase option on this property. Stations mortgaged its interest in this property in connection with the purchase. Stations had previously leased this property and had mortgaged its leasehold interest to the collateral agent under its credit facility, which leasehold mortgage will be released at the time of the merger.Legal Proceedings On March 22, 2002, Stations filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. Benedek and its subsidiaries are not party to the bankruptcy action. On July 1,33PAGEBREAK 2002, Stations filed its proposed plan of reorganization and related disclosure statement with respect to its bankruptcy case for approval by the court. The plan of reorganization contemplates completion of the merger of Gray MidAmerica Television with and into Stations. In conjunction with the execution of the merger agreement, Stations and Gray entered into Lock up, Voting and Consent Agreements with certain stockholders and creditors of Stations. Under the lock up, voting and consent agreements, these stockholders and creditors agreed to, among other things, support and vote their shares or interests, as applicable, in favor of Stations&#146 plan of reorganization that will give effect to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. As of the date of this report, lock up, voting and consent agreements have been received from holders of 97.9% of the outstanding Stations senior preferred stock, 98.8% of the outstanding Stations junior preferred stock, 100.0% of the outstanding Stations class B common stock and 94.6% of the outstanding Stations senior notes. Stations is currently and from time to time involved in litigation incidental to the conduct of its business. Stations is not currently a party to any such lawsuit or proceeding that, in its opinion, is likely to have a material adverse effect on us.34PAGEBREAK link1 "STATIONS SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA"STATIONS SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA The table below sets forth the selected consolidated financial data of Stations for the five years ended December 31, 2001 and the three month periods ended March 31, 2001 and 2002. The selected consolidated financial data for the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001 have been derived from Stations&#146 audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. The data for the three month periods ended March 31, 2001 and 2002 are unaudited, but have been prepared on the same basis as the audited financial statements. In Stations&#146 opinion, they reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly Stations&#146 results of operation for the period then ended and its financial position as of such dates. Operating results for the three month period ended March 31, 2002 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in the future.

(b)In January 1999, Stations entered into a time brokerage agreement in anticipation of the station exchange of KKTV, Colorado Springs-Pueblo, Colorado and KCOY-TV, Santa Maria, California. The statement of operations and other data for the year ended December 31, 1999 includes information with respect to the time brokerage agreement. In March 2000, Stations exchanged WWLP-TV, its station in Springfield, Massachusetts, and $18.0 million for KAKE-TV, Wichita, Kansas and WOWT-TV, Omaha, Nebraska. The statement of operations does not reflect the exchange prior to March 2000. (c)Net revenues reflect deductions from gross revenues for agency and national sales representative commissions. (d)Net gain on sale of stations for 1999 includes $13.3 million as a result of the 1999 station exchange netted against a $6.9 million loss on the sale of KOSA-TV, Odessa, Texas. In 2000, net gain on sale of stations includes a $61.1 million gain on the exchange of WWLP-TV, Springfield, Massachusetts, for KAKE-TV, Wichita, Kansas and WOWT-TV, Omaha, Nebraska, and a $0.3 million gain on the sale of KOSA-TV, Odessa, Texas. (e)Cash interest expense, net, includes cash interest paid and normal adjustments to accrued interest. Other interest expense includes accrued interest added to long-term debt balances, deferred loan cost amortization and write- offs, except deferred loan cost write-offs related to extraordinary debt extinguishments, financing costs not consummated, and accretion of discounts. (f)In 1999, Stations recorded an extraordinary loss of $12.5 million net of applicable taxes of $8.3 million as a result of the early extinguishment of debt associated with the completion of the tender offer for $135.0 million of outstanding senior secured notes. In 2000, Stations redeemed a portion of its 13 1/4% senior subordinated discount notes with an aggregate face value of $12.3 million. The discount notes had an accreted value of $11.4 million and were purchased for $9.8 million. A total of $0.9 million, net of taxes, was recorded as a gain on the early extinguishment of debt. (g)Earnings (loss) per common share is computed by dividing income (loss) after the deduction of preferred dividends and accretion of the redemption prepayment premium and amortization of our initial warrants, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. The effect of the stock options and initial warrants has not been reflected in the computation since their inclusion as common stock equivalents for both basic and fully-diluted earnings (loss) per share was anti-dilutive.36PAGEBREAK (h)Broadcast cash flow is defined as operating income before financial income as derived from the consolidated statements of operations plus depreciation and amortization, amortization of program broadcast rights, corporate expenses and noncash compensation less payments on program broadcast liabilities and net gain on sale of stations. Broadcast cash flow data is included in this report because the information is a measurement: (1)used by lenders to measure a borrower&#146 s ability to service its debt and pay for capital expenditures (2)used by industry analysts to determine a market value of television stations and (3)used by industry analysts when evaluating and comparing operating performance of different companies.

(k)Operating cash flow margin is defined as operating cash flow divided by net revenues. (l)Long-term debt is defined as notes payable, including the current portion thereof, net of discount. At March 31, 2002, long-term debt includes the balance of Stations&#146 credit facility of $276.0 million and the discount notes of $154.7 million, which are classified as &#147 Liabilities subject to compromise&#148 on the March 31, 2002 balance sheet. (m)Intangible assets at December 31, 2001 and March 31, 2002 include balances of $15.5 million and $20.2 million, respectively, which are classified as &#147 Assets of Stations held for sale&#148 on the respective balance sheets.37PAGEBREAK link1 "STATIONS MANAGEMENT&#146 S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION"STATIONS MANAGEMENT&#146 S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISOF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONOverview On April 1, 2002, Stations signed a letter of intent with Gray and subsequently executed a merger agreement on June 4, 2002 whereby Stations will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gray. Gray will pay an estimated $502.5 million in cash consideration in connection with the merger and the transaction is expected to close during the fourth quarter of 2002. Pursuant to the letter of intent with Gray, Stations agreed to sell all of the television broadcasting assets of eight television stations (the &#147 Station Group&#148 ) to a third party prior to its merger with Gray. On June 4, 2002, Stations signed an agreement with Chelsey Broadcasting, LLC to sell the Station Group for $30.0 million. On November 16, 2001, Stations entered into an Asset Purchase agreement with West Virginia Media Holdings, LLC (&#147 West Virginia Media&#148 ) pursuant to which, on April 30, 2002, Stations sold the television broadcast assets of WTRF-TV, in Wheeling, West Virginia for $18.5 million. Stations elected to early adopt Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 (&#147 SFAS No. 144&#148 ) &#147 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets&#148 for its 2001 financial statements. As a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 144, the Station Group and WTRF-TV have been classified as assets held for sale at March 31, 2002 and accordingly the carrying value of the assets were adjusted to their fair value and the operations of these portions of Stations have been reported in discontinued operations. Stations&#146 revenues are derived primarily from the sale of advertising time and, to a modest extent, from compensation paid by the networks for broadcasting network programming and barter transactions for goods and services. Revenues depend on Stations&#146 ability to provide programming that attracts audiences in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers. Stations&#146 revenues also depend significantly on factors such as the national and local economy and the level of local competition. In March 2000, Stations restructured the organization of its local sales departments to place a greater emphasis on local and regional advertising sales. Stations shifted certain local advertising accounts to national representatives to better reflect the actual source of revenues. As a result of the restructuring and its new philosophy, year-to-year comparisons of trends in Stations&#146 local/regional and national sales for the years 2000 and 2001 will be difficult for you to make. On March 31, 2000, Stations completed a transaction with WGRC, Inc., whereby it exchanged the television station assets of WWLP-TV, in Springfield, Massachusetts formerly owned by it plus $18.0 million for the television station assets of KAKE-TV, in Wichita, Kansas, together with its two satellite stations, and WOWT-TV in Omaha, Nebraska. The acquired stations were owned by The Chronicle Publishing Company and were acquired in a like-kind exchange transaction through WGRC, Inc. The transaction was recorded under the purchase method of accounting. On March 21, 2000, Stations sold the television broadcast assets of KOSA-TV, in Odessa, Texas to ICA Broadcasting I, Ltd. for a cash payment of $8.0 million. Stations recorded a lower of cost or market adjustment of approximately $6.9 million in 1999 to write down the assets of KOSA-TV to the sales price less estimated selling costs. The exchange of WWLP-TV and the sale of KOSA-TV resulted in a gain on sale of stations before taxes of $61.4 million in 2000. During October 1998, Stations transferred WMTV-TV, its station in Madison, Wisconsin to The WMTV Trust due to the Grade A broadcast signal overlap between WMTV-TV and WIFR-TV, Stations&#146 station in Rockford, Illinois. Under the trust arrangement, Stations relinquished control of WMTV-TV to a trustee while retaining the economic risks and benefits of ownership. On August 5, 1999, the FCC approved new duopoly rules that enabled Stations to own both WMTV-TV and WIFR-TV. As a result of38PAGEBREAK the new rules, The WMTV Trust was dissolved on February 29, 2000 and all assets and liabilities were transferred to Stations. Local and national non-political advertising sales constitute the largest concentration of Stations&#146 revenues and represent approximately 90% of gross revenues in 2001 compared to approximately 82% in 2000. Excluding political advertising revenues from our gross revenues, the percentage of gross revenues attributable to Stations&#146 local/regional advertising and national advertising in 1999, 2000 and 2001 was approximately 90%, 91% and 91%, respectively. Approximately 60% of Stations&#146 gross revenues in 2001 were generated from local and regional advertising, which is sold primarily by each station&#146 s sales staffs. The remainder of Stations&#146 advertising revenues is comprised primarily of national advertising, which is sold by national sales representatives retained by Stations. Stations generally pay commissions to advertising agencies on local, regional and national advertising and to national sales representatives on national advertising. Net revenues reflect deductions from gross revenues for commissions payable to advertising agencies and national sales representatives. Stations&#146 primary operating expenses are employee compensation, programming expense, and depreciation and amortization. Changes in compensation expense result primarily from adjustments to fixed salaries based on employee performance and, to a lesser extent, from changes in sales commissions paid based on levels of advertising revenues. Programming expense consists primarily of amortization of program rights. Stations purchases first run and off-network syndicated programming on an ongoing basis. Under Stations&#146 contracts with the networks, a network affiliated station receives more than half of its daily programming from its network and in turn is compensated, in most cases, by the network for carrying such programming with the network&#146 s commercial content intact. Barter expense generally offsets barter revenues and reflects the fair market value of goods and services received. Stations&#146 operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, represent approximately 65% of net revenues from continuing operations for 2001 compared to 60% of net revenues in both 2000 and 1999.Results of Operations The following table sets forth certain of Stations&#146 historical results of operations and operating data for the periods indicated in order to reconcile its broadcast cash flow and operating cash flow.

The improvement in net revenues from continuing operations in 2002 is a result of political advertising revenues, the winter Olympics on Stations&#146 four NBC affiliated stations and a significant increase in local advertising revenues due to the successful efforts toward increasing this portion of Stations&#146 advertising base. National advertising revenues in the first quarter of 2002 remained constant at $8.4 million as compared to the same period in 2001. Local/ regional revenues increased and were $18.2 million in the three months ended March 31, 2002 compared to $15.9 million for the same period in 2001, an increase of $2.3 million or 14.3%. Political advertising revenues were $0.5 million in the first quarter of 2002 as compared to $0.3 million in the same period in 2001. Operating expenses.Stations had operating expenses in the first quarter of 2002 of $24.1 million, an increase of $0.4 million or 1.7% compared to $23.7 million in the same period in 2001. Depreciation and amortization increased by $0.9 million or 17.5% to $6.3 million as compared to $5.4 million in the same period in 2001 due to the shorter amortization period used for network affiliation intangible assets as a result of the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 &#147 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets&#148 (SFAS No. 142) on January 1, 2002. The effect of the shorter amortization period used for network affiliation intangible assets more than offset the effect caused by the discontinuance of amortization on Stations&#146 intangibles related to its FCC licenses and goodwill. Amortization was discontinued on FCC intangible assets and goodwill in the first quarter of 2002 due to the requirement of SFAS No. 142 that specifies that intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are no longer subject to amortization.40PAGEBREAK Operating income (loss).Stations&#146 operating income for the first quarter of 2002 increased by $1.6 million to $1.5 million from an operating loss of $(0.1) million for the same period in 2001.

Discontinued operations.Stations&#146 loss from operations of discontinued stations was $(22.0) million for the first quarter 2002 as compared to $(1.6) million for the comparable period in 2001. Before income taxes, the loss on the operations of discontinued stations was $(33.5) million for the first quarter of 2002 as compared to $(2.4) million in the first quarter of 2001. Included in the first quarter 2002 was a $31.3 million writedown to the expected sales price of the assets of the Station Group. Broadcast cash flow.Broadcast cash flow for the first quarter of 2002 increased $2.1 million or 30.2% to $9.0 million from $6.9 million for the first quarter of 2001.

Stations&#146 net revenues were negatively impacted by the absence of political revenues in 2001 which were $1.4 million as compared to $13.2 million in 2000. Excluding political advertising revenues and before direct costs, Stations&#146 gross revenues decreased by $1.1 million or 0.9% to $121.7 million for 2001 from $122.8 million for 2000 due to a protracted softening of the advertising market and the negative effects on the advertising market and the economy in general as a result of the attacks of September 11, 2001. Operating expenses.Stations&#146 operating expenses in 2001 increased by $2.7 million or 2.9% to $91.9 million from $89.2 million in 2000. The increase in operating expenses was caused by the change in the mix of stations owned by Stations, with the March 2000 addition of KAKE-TV and WOWT-TV and the disposition of WWLP-TV and KOSA-TV. The effect of the change of stations was greatest on depreciation and amortization expenses which increased $2.2 million or 11.1% to $21.9 million for 2001 as compared to $19.7 million for 2000. As a percentage of net revenues, operating expenses increased to 85.4% for 2001 compared to 76.5% for 2000. Gain on sale of stations, net.In 2000, Stations recognized a gain of $61.1 million as a result of the exchange of the assets of WWLP-TV with a fair market value of $123.0 million and $18.0 million in cash for the assets of KAKE-TV and WOWT-TV. Stations also realized a $0.3 million gain on the sale of KOSA-TV in 2000. KOSA-TV was sold for $8.0 million. Operating income.Stations&#146 operating income for 2001 decreased $73.2 million or 82.3% to $15.7 million from $88.9 million for 2000. The change in operating income was primarily caused by the gain on sale of stations in March 2000 and increased depreciation and amortization expense.42PAGEBREAK Financial income (expense).Stations&#146 financial expense for 2001 decreased $0.7 million or 1.7% to $43.2 million from $43.9 million in 2000 as a result of declining interest rates. Income tax benefit (expense).Stations&#146 income tax benefit in 2001 was $10.2 million compared to an income tax expense of $29.2 million for 2000. The decrease in income tax expense in 2001 from 2000 was primarily due to the tax effect of the sale of WWLP-TV and KOSA-TV in March 2000. For tax purposes, the sale of the WWLP-TV assets was treated as an exchange for the assets of KAKE-TV and WOWT-TV under the Internal Revenue Service like-kind exchange rules. As such, Stations had a $2.2 million gain for tax purposes. Discontinued operations.Stations&#146 loss from discontinued operations was $(28.1) million in 2001 as compared to $(0.9) million in 2000. Before income taxes, Stations&#146 loss from discontinued operations was $(29.8) million in 2001 as compared to $(0.2) million in 2000. Discontinued operations consist of the operating results and valuation adjustments related to WTRF-TV and the Station Group. Included in discontinued operations for 2001 was a write-down to fair value on the sale of WTRF-TV of $6.9 million as well as $17.7 million of valuation adjustments on certain other stations&#146 goodwill and network affiliation intangible assets that were determined to have been impaired based on estimated discounted future cash flows. During 2002, these certain stations were held for sale and the valuation adjustments have been reclassified to discontinued operations consistent with the restatement provisions of SFAS No. 144. Net income (loss).Stations had a net loss of $(45.4) million for 2001 as compared to net income of $15.8 million for 2000. Broadcast cash flow.Broadcast cash flow for 2001 decreased $9.3 million or 17.4% to $43.9 million from $53.2 million for 2000.

Stations&#146 net revenues were positively impacted by political revenues in 2000 which were $13.2 million compared to $1.3 million in 1999. Excluding political advertising revenues and before direct costs, Stations&#146 gross revenues increased by $9.4 million or 8.3% to $122.8 million for 2000 from $113.4 million for 1999 due to the exchange of WWLP for KAKE-TV and WOWT-TV which was offset in part by a softening advertising market and the displacement of commercial advertisers by political advertisers. Operating expenses.Stations&#146 operating expenses in 2000 increased by $12.1 million or 15.7% to $89.2 million from $77.1 million in 1999. The increase in operating expenses was caused by the change in the mix of stations owned by Stations, with the March 2000 addition of KAKE-TV and WOWT-TV and the disposition of WWLP-TV and KOSA-TV.

The book value of the WWLP-TV assets was $61.4 million and related fees were $0.4 million. Stations also realized a $0.3 million gain on the sale of KOSA-TV in 2000. KOSA-TV was sold for $8.0 million and fees related to the sale were $0.1 million. Operating income.Stations&#146 operating income for 2000 increased $60.2 million or 209.3% to $88.9 million from $28.7 million for 1999 primarily from the gain on the sale of stations.44PAGEBREAK Financial income (expense).Stations&#146 financial expense, net, for 2000 increased $4.2 million or 10.6% to $43.9 million from $39.7 million in 1999 as a result of higher interest rates and to a lesser extent to greater accretion on the 13 1/4% senior subordinated discount notes. Discontinued operations.Stations&#146 loss from discontinued operations was $(0.9) million in 2000 as compared to $(4.4) million in 1999. Before income taxes, Stations&#146 loss from discontinued operations was $(0.2) million in 2000 as compared to $(6.1) million in 1999. Discontinued operations consist of the operating results and valuation adjustments related to the Station Group. Included in discontinued operations for 1999 was $2.8 million of valuation adjustments on certain stations&#146 goodwill and network affiliation intangible assets that were determined to have been impaired based on estimated discounted future cash flows. During 2002, these certain stations were held for sale and the valuation adjustments have been reclassified to discontinued operations consistent with SFAS No. 144. Income tax expense.Stations&#146 income tax expense in 2000 was $29.2 million compared to $0.4 million for 1999. The increase in income tax expense in 2000 was due in part to the $61.1 million gain on the sale of WWLP-TV. For tax purposes, the sale of the WWLP-TV assets was treated as an exchange for the assets of KAKE-TV and WOWT-TV under the IRS like-kind exchange rules. As such, Stations had a $2.2 million gain for tax purposes compared with the book gain of $61.1 million. Extraordinary gain (loss).Extraordinary gain was $0.9 million for 2000, net of $0.6 million in income taxes and consisted of an early extinguishment of debt. The gain was recognized when Stations purchased its 13 1/4% senior subordinated discount notes with a face amount of $12.3 million for $9.8 million. The notes Stations purchased had an accreted value of $11.4 million. In 1999, Stations recorded an extraordinary loss of $(12.5) million, net of $8.3 million in income taxes. The loss was a result of the early extinguishment of debt associated with the completion of the tender offer for $135.0 million of Benedek&#146 s senior secured notes. Net income (loss).Stations&#146 net income was $15.8 million for 2000 compared to a net loss of $(28.3) million for 1999.

As a percentage of net revenues, broadcast cash flow margin increased to 45.6% for 2000 from 44.9% for 1999.Income Taxes For the year ended December 31, 2001, Stations had an income tax benefit of $10.2 million compared to an income tax expense of $29.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The change in income taxes is due primarily to the $61.1 million gain on the sale of WWLP-TV in 2000. For tax purposes, the sale of the WWLP-TV assets was treated as an exchange for the assets of KAKE-TV and WOWT-TV under the Internal Revenue Service like-kind exchange rules. As such, Stations had a $2.2 million gain for tax purposes. At March 31, 2002, Stations has approximately $35.7 million of actual net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future tax liabilities. These net operating loss carryforwards expire in the years 2020 through 2023. Stations also has approximately $0.5 million of tax credit carryforwards with no expiration.Seasonality Stations net revenues and operating cash flow are generally highest during the fourth quarter of each year. This is primarily due to increased expenditures by advertisers in anticipation of holiday season consumer spending and an increase in viewership during this period. Generally, the second quarter of each year produces net revenues and operating cash flow greater than the first and third quarters due to higher viewership in this period.45PAGEBREAK Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk During September 2001, in accordance with certain covenants of Benedek&#146 s credit facility, Benedek entered into an interest rate cap agreement, which matures in September 2003. The agreement reduces the impact of changes in interest rates on Benedek&#146 s floating-rate long-term debt. That agreement effectively entitles Benedek to receive from a financial institution the amount, if any, by which the British Bankers&#146 Association interest settlement rates for U.S. dollar deposits exceeds 6.00% on a notional amount totaling $60.0 million subject to an amortization schedule. As of March 31, 2002, the settlement rate was 1.90%.46PAGEBREAK link1 "UNAUDITED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL DATA"UNAUDITED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL DATA The unaudited pro forma financial data presented below is for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the operating results that would have actually occurred, nor is it necessarily indicative of future operating results.

(formerly Benedek Communications Corporation) and SubsidiariesHoffman Estates, Illinois We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Stations Holding Company, Inc. (&#147 Stations&#148 ) and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 2001 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders&#146 (deficit) and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001. These financial statements are the responsibility of Stations&#146 management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Stations and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 2001 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that Stations will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note Q to the consolidated financial statements, Stations is currently in default under its Credit Facility and Discount Notes and has filed for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code subsequent to year-end. This raises substantial doubt about Stations&#146 ability to continue as a going concern. Management&#146 s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note Q. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. As described in Note O to the consolidated financial statements, Stations has elected to early adopt the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, &#147 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.&#148 /s/ McGLADREY &#38 PULLEN, LLPRockford, IllinoisMarch 15, 2002, except for the subsequentevents described in Note Q as to whichthe date is June 4, 2002F-2PAGEBREAK STATIONS HOLDING COMPANY, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Note A) &#151 Nature of Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Business Stations Holding Company, Inc. and its subsidiaries (&#147 Stations&#148 ), formerly known as Benedek Communications Corporation, is a holding company with minimal operations other than from its wholly owned subsidiary, Benedek Broadcasting Corporation (&#147 Benedek&#148 ). Benedek owns and operates twenty-three television stations located throughout the United States. Stations&#146 revenues are derived primarily from the sale of advertising time and, to a modest extent from compensation paid by the networks for broadcasting network programming and barter transactions for goods and services. Stations sells commercial time during the programs to national, regional and local advertisers. The networks also sell commercial time during the programs to national advertisers. Credit arrangements are determined on an individual customer basis. Segment information is not presented since all of Stations&#146 revenue is attributed to a single reportable segment. Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Stations and its wholly owned subsidiary, Benedek. Benedek has three wholly owned subsidiaries, Benedek License Corporation, Benedek Cable, Inc. and Benedek Interactive Media, LLC (the &#147 Benedek Subsidiaries&#148 ). All significant intercompany items and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Significant Accounting Policies (1) Accounting estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. (2) Cash equivalents and concentration Stations considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. At various times during the periods, Stations had cash and cash equivalents on deposit with a financial institution in excess of federal depository insurance limits. Stations has not experienced any credit losses on these deposits. (3) Revenues Revenue related to the sale of advertising is recognized at the time of broadcast. Net revenues are shown net of agency and national representatives&#146 commissions. Deferred revenues primarily relate to compensation paid by the network at the inception of the network affiliation agreement. This revenue is being recognized prorata until 2005, on a straight-line method. (4) Barter transactions Revenue from barter transactions (advertising provided in exchange for goods and services) is recognized as income when advertisements are broadcast and merchandise or services received are charged to expense (or capitalized as appropriate) when received or used. The transactions are recorded at the fairF-8PAGEBREAK STATIONS HOLDING COMPANY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#151 (Continued)market value of the asset or service received. For the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001, revenues from barter transactions totaled approximately $6,377,000, $6,182,000 and $6,111,000, respectively. (5) Program broadcast rights and liabilities Program broadcast rights represent rights for the telecast of feature length motion pictures, series produced for television and other films, and are presented at the lower of amortized cost or net realizable value. Each agreement is recorded as an asset and liability when the license period begins and the program is available for its first showing. Program broadcast rights are amortized on a straight-line method over the life of the contract, which is included in selling, technical and program expenses. The agreements are classified between current and long-term assets according to the estimated time of future usage. The related liability is classified between current and long-term on the basis of the payment terms. (6) Deferred loan and acquisition costs Deferred loan costs are amounts incurred in connection with long-term financing. The costs are amortized on the interest method over the terms of the related debt security. Costs incurred in connection with long-term financing which is not consummated are expensed at the point in time when the negotiation on the financing ceases. Costs incurred in connection with issuances of preferred stock are included in stockholders&#146 deficit as a permanent reduction of additional paid-in capital. Acquisition costs are amounts incurred in connection with acquiring additional television stations. Costs incurred in connection with acquisitions, which are not consummated, are expensed at the point in time when the negotiation on the acquisition ceases. The acquisition costs related to successful acquisitions are treated as part of the purchase price and are allocated to the assets purchased. (7) Property and equipment and intangible assets (a) Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the following estimated ranges of useful lives: YearsBuildings and improvements 5-40 Towers 5-12 Transmission equipment 3-10 Other equipment 1-5 Gains and losses on the disposition of property and equipment in the normal course of business are insignificant and are included in depreciation and amortization on the consolidated statement of operations. (b) Intangible assets, which include FCC licenses, network affiliation agreements and goodwill, have been recorded at cost and are amortized over 40 years using the straight-line method. (c) Stations reviews its property and equipment and intangibles annually to determine potential impairment by comparing the carrying value of the assets with the undiscounted anticipated future cash flows of the related property before interest charges. If the future cash flows are less than the carrying value, Stations would obtain an appraisal or discount the future cash flows to determine fair value, and adjust the carrying value of the assets to the estimated fair value if the fair value is less than the carrying value (Note E).F-9PAGEBREAK STATIONS HOLDING COMPANY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#151 (Continued) (8) Other interest expense Other interest expense includes accrued interest added to long-term debt balances, deferred loan cost amortization and write offs (except deferred loan cost write offs related to extraordinary debt extinguishments), financing costs not consummated, and accretion of discounts. (9) Income taxes Deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences, operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. Stations and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return. (10) Employee Benefits Stations has defined contribution plans covering all eligible employees. Stations&#146 contribution is at the discretion of the Board of Directors. Stations self-insures for health benefits, which are provided to all full-time employees with specified periods of service. Insurance coverage is maintained by Stations for claims in excess of specific and annual aggregate limits. Stations has elected to continue accounting for employee stock-based compensation under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25. (11) Earnings (loss) per common share Basic per-share amounts are computed by dividing net income (loss) adjusted for preferred stock dividends declared and accretion (the numerator) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding (the denominator). Diluted per-share amounts assume the conversion, exercise or issuance of all potential common stock instruments unless the effect is to reduce the loss or increase the income per common share from continuing operations. Stations has no present dilutive per-share amounts, since the inclusion of the Initial Warrants (as defined) and stock options would have been anti-dilutive for the periods presented.(12) Interest rate cap agreement and recently adopted accounting standard Interest rate cap agreements are used to manage interest rate exposure by hedging certain liabilities. Income and expense are accrued under the terms of the agreement based on the expected settlement payments and are recorded as a component of interest income or expense. Effective January 1, 2001, Stations adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, &#147 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,&#148 as amended by SFAS Nos. 137 and 138. The new accounting standards require all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in fair value of the derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or in other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as a fair value or cash flow hedge. The ineffective portion of all hedges is recognized in current period earnings. On adoption Stations&#146 only derivative instrument was an interest rate cap for which the fair value approximated the carrying value.F-10PAGEBREAK STATIONS HOLDING COMPANY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#151 (Continued)(Note B) &#151 Acquisition and Sale of Certain Television Stations On December 30, 1998, Stations entered into an Asset Exchange Agreement with The Ackerley Group, Inc. (&#147 Ackerley&#148 ) pursuant to which Stations exchanged the television broadcast assets of KCOY-TV, in Santa Maria, California, for the television broadcast assets of KKTV, Ackerley&#146 s station in Colorado Springs, Colorado (the &#147 1999 Swap&#148 ). Both KCOY-TV and KKTV are CBS affiliates. The exchange was completed on May 1, 1999, upon which Stations paid $9,000,000 to Ackerley as further consideration in accordance with the agreement. The exchange was recorded as a separate sale and acquisition of stations, with the acquisition of KKTV accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. Accordingly, the results of the operations for KKTV are included in Stations&#146 consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition, May 1, 1999. In addition, the parties entered into a time brokerage agreement for each station, in effect from January 1, 1999 until April 30, 1999. During the time brokerage period, the revenue and expenses of each station went to the account of the buyer, net of applicable time brokerage fees. The net time brokerage fee expense was $508,000 for the year ended December 31, 1999. The total purchase price for KKTV was approximately $33,631,000, which consisted of the fair market value of the KCOY-TV assets of $24,272,000, a cash payment of $9,000,000, and fees and costs of the transaction of $359,000. The purchase price has been allocated to acquired assets and liabilities based on their relative fair values as of the closing date. The excess of the purchase price over the net assets received from the acquisition is being amortized on the straight-line method over a period of 40 years. A gain of approximately $13,323,000 was recorded to reflect the sale of KCOY-TV. This gain consisted of the fair market value of the KCOY-TV assets of $24,272,000 less their book value of $10,732,000 and fees of $217,000. During September 1999, a loss in the amount of approximately $222,000 was recorded to reflect the sale of KTVS-TV, Sterling, Colorado, which was a satellite operation of KGWN-TV, Cheyenne, Wyoming. Stations sold KTVS-TV since KTVS-TV is outside of the KGWN-TV designated market area. The loss is included in &#147 Loss from operations of discontinued stations&#148 in the consolidated statement of operations as KGWN-TV is one of the stations included in the Station Group to be sold. See (Note Q). On November 19, 1999, Stations entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with The Chronicle Publishing Company (&#147 Chronicle&#148 ) and on December 10, 1999, Stations entered into an Asset Exchange Agreement with WGRC, Inc. (&#147 WGRC&#148 ). Pursuant to these agreements, WGRC acquired the television broadcast assets of WOWT-TV and KAKE-TV, Chronicle&#146 s television stations in Omaha, Nebraska and Wichita, Kansas, respectively, and then immediately transferred the same to the Company in exchange for the television broadcast assets of WWLP-TV, Stations&#146 station in Springfield, Massachusetts (the &#147 2000 Swap&#148 ). The exchange was completed on March 31, 2000, upon which Stations paid $18,000,000 to WGRC as further consideration in accordance with the agreements. At December 31, 1999, Stations had deposited $10,000,000 in an escrow account related to this transaction. The remaining $8,000,000 was funded from the proceeds of the sale of KOSA-TV discussed below. The exchange was recorded as a separate sale and acquisition of stations, with the acquisition of KAKE-TV and WOWT-TV accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. Accordingly, the results of the operations for KAKE-TV and WOWT-TV are included in Stations&#146 consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition, March 31, 2000. The total purchase price and costs of the acquisition of KAKE-TV and WOWT-TV was approximately $141,839,000, which consisted of the fair market value of the WWLP-TV assets of $122,961,000, a cash payment of $18,000,000 and fees and costs of the transaction of approximatelyF-11PAGEBREAK STATIONS HOLDING COMPANY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#151 (Continued)$878,000. The purchase price has been allocated to acquired assets and liabilities based on their relative fair market values as of the closing date. A gain of approximately $61,144,000 was recorded to reflect the disposition of WWLP-TV. The gain consisted of the fair market value of the WWLP-TV assets of $122,961,000 less their book value of $61,431,000 and fees of $386,000. On December 15, 1999, Stations entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with ICA Broadcasting I, Ltd. (&#147 ICA&#148 ) pursuant to which Stations sold the television broadcast assets of KOSA-TV, in Odessa, Texas to ICA for a cash payment of $8,000,000 on March 21, 2000 (the &#147 2000 Sale&#148 ). A gain of approximately $262,000 was recorded on the sale of KOSA-TV, which consisted of the excess of the $8,000,000 sale price over the book value of the assets of $7,642,000 less fees of the transaction. Stations wrote down the KOSA-TV assets during 1999 by $6,920,000, as a result of the signing of the Asset Purchase Agreement with ICA, which contemplated the sale. The unaudited pro forma results of operations and earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 1999 and 2000, assuming the 1999 Swap, 2000 Swap and 2000 Sale had occurred on January 1, 1999 and 2000, are presented in the table below.

The pro forma results do not include the gain on the disposition of KCOY-TV, WWLP-TV and KOSA-TV, nor the write down of KOSA-TV&#146 s assets in contemplation of the sale, for either period presented. The pro forma information does not necessarily reflect the actual results that would have occurred nor is it necessarily indicative of future results of the operations of the stations. Sale of Station On November 26, 2001, Stations entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with West Virginia Media Holdings, LLC (&#147 West Virginia Media&#148 ) pursuant to which Stations will sell the television broadcast assets of WTRF-TV, in Wheeling, West Virginia to West Virginia Media for $18,500,000. Upon the execution of the agreement, Stations received a $350,000 option payment from West Virginia which will reduce the final purchase price. Stations recorded a lower of cost or market adjustment of approximately $6,880,000 in 2001 to write down the assets of WTRF-TV to the sales price. Because Stations has elected to early adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 144, &#147 Accounting for the Impairment orF-12PAGEBREAK STATIONS HOLDING COMPANY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#151 (Continued)Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,&#148 as discussed in [Note O], this lower of cost or market adjustment is included in &#147 Loss from operations of discontinued stations.&#148 The assets of WTRF-TV have been shown on the accompanying balance sheet as &#147 Assets of station held for sale&#148 as of December 31, 2001. It is anticipated that the sale will be completed in the second quarter of 2002. See (Note Q).(Note C) &#151 Related Party Transactions and 1999 Stock Option Plan Stock Option Agreements In 1998, a key employee exercised all outstanding options granted to him under a stock-based compensation plan for the employee. Stations loaned the key employee the funds necessary to pay for the shares under a note for $555,000 which bears interest at 5.93% and is due on December 31, 2007. This recourse note, which is a personal obligation of the employee, is collateralized by the stock, which was issued upon exercise of the option, and is classified as a negative equity account in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. During 2001, Stations amended the above-mentioned key employee&#146 s employment agreement whereby he will receive compensation sufficient to satisfy the obligation and any related income tax liability, provided that he remains an active employee through the earlier of death, disability, termination by Stations without cause, or December 31, 2003. This obligation is being accrued ratably through December 31, 2003. In connection therewith, Stations recognized expense of approximately $107,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001. In December 1998, Stations&#146 board of directors adopted the 1999 Stock Option Plan (the &#147 Plan&#148 ) whereby from time to time on or before December 31, 2008, options to purchase shares of class B common stock may be granted to employees, directors or consultants and advisors of Stations and its subsidiaries. The aggregate number of shares of common stock, which may be purchased pursuant to options granted at any time under the Plan, shall not exceed 240,000. The purchase price per share shall be the fair market value, as defined by the Plan, or an amount determined by the board. If options are granted to an employee who, at the time of the grant, owns more than ten percent of the voting stock of Stations, the purchase price per share shall be at least one hundred and ten percent of the fair market value, as defined by the Plan. The vesting period of options granted under the Plan are determined by the board. The maximum term options may be outstanding under the plan is ten years.

AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#151 (Continued) As permitted under generally accepted accounting principles, Stations accounts for the employee options under the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25 and its related interpretations. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for the grant of the options. Had compensation cost been determined based on the fair value method prescribed in FASB Statement No. 123, the reported net income (loss) and basic and diluted (loss) per common share for the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001 would have been $(28,395) and $(6.40), $15,805 and $(1.10), and $(45,432) and $(10.35), respectively. In determining the pro forma amounts for the options granted in 1999, the fair value per share for each option was estimated to be $6.61 at the grant date by using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: no dividends will be paid on the class B common stock a risk-free interest rate of 4.44% an expected life of five years and an expected price volatility of 43.0%. In determining the pro forma amounts for the options granted in 2001, the fair value per share for each option was estimated to be $0.97 at the grant date by using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: no dividends will be paid on the class B common stock a risk-free interest rate of 4.91% an expected life of six years and an expected price volatility of 64.0%. Director Fees Stations paid fees of approximately $871,000, $896,000, and $974,000 during the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively, to the law firm of Shack Siegel Katz Flaherty &#38 Goodman, P.C. A partner of Shack Siegel Katz Flaherty &#38 Goodman, P.C. serves as a director to Stations. Notes Receivable-Officers During 1999 and 2000 Stations issued loans to various officers of Stations for which the total amounts receivable as of December 31, 2000 and 2001 were $1,717,000 and $1,702,000, respectively. These notes bear interest at the applicable federal rates in effect at the time of issuance and have due dates ranging from May 1, 2002 to December 31, 2003. These notes are personal obligations of the applicable officer and have been issued with recourse. On March 1, 2002, the foregoing notes due from one officer were consolidated into a single note in the amount of $1,635,000, representing the aggregate outstanding principal and interest due to Stations from the officer. The maturity of such loans was extended until the earlier of June 30, 2002 or the date the employee sells his securities in Stations. The interest is payable at maturity and accrues at the applicable federal rate in effect on March 1, 2002.F-14PAGEBREAK STATIONS HOLDING COMPANY, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#151 (Continued)(Note F) &#151 Redeemable Equity Securities and Discount Notes Senior Preferred Stock In 1996, Stations sold 60,000 Units in a private placement, which generated proceeds of $60,000,000. Each Unit consisted of (i) ten shares of 15% Exchangeable Redeemable Senior Preferred Stock due 2007 (the &#147 Original Senior Preferred Stock&#148 ), (ii) ten initial warrants to purchase class A common stock of Stations with an expiration date of July 1, 2007 (the &#147 Initial Warrants&#148 ) and (iii) 14.8 contingent warrants to purchase class A common stock of Stations. The Original Senior Preferred Stock and the contingent warrants were redeemed in June 1998 from the proceeds of Stations&#146 May 14, 1998 issuance of 100,000 shares of 11.5% Senior Exchangeable Preferred Stock (the &#147 Senior Preferred Stock&#148 ), with an initial liquidation preference equal to proceeds received of $100,000,000. Dividends on the Senior Preferred Stock are cumulative and payable quarterly commencing August 15, 1998 at a rate of 11.5% of the then effective liquidation preference per share. Stations, at its option, may pay dividends on any dividend payment date occurring on or before May 15, 2003 either in cash or by adding such dividends to the then effective liquidation preference. Stations has been adding the dividends to the liquidation preference from the issuance date through December 31, 2001. The Senior Preferred Stock is not redeemable until May 15, 2003 at which time cash dividends are required to be paid at a rate of 11.5% of the then effective liquidation preference per share. Thereafter, Stations has the option to redeem these shares in whole or in part at predetermined redemption prices prior to May 15, 2008 when they are due. The Senior Preferred Stock is exchangeable into debentures at Stations&#146 option, subject to certain conditions, in whole on any scheduled dividend payment date. The Senior Preferred Stock contains various restrictive covenants relating to limitations on dividends, transactions with affiliates, further issuance of debt, and the sales of assets, among other things. Since it was originally management&#146 s intention to redeem the Senior Preferred Stock prior to the date that cash dividends are required to be paid, the amount of the estimated redemption premium payable had been accreted as a constructive distribution over five years since May 1998. During the fourth quarter of 2001, management determined that the redemption of the Senior Preferred Stock was unlikely to occur based on Stations&#146 financial position as described in (Note Q). As a result, accretion has been discontinued on the redemption premium for future periods. Junior Preferred Stock In 1996, Stations issued 450,000 shares of Seller Junior Discount Preferred Stock due July 1, 2008 (the &#147 Junior Preferred Stock&#148 ) with an aggregate liquidation preference equal to the proceeds of $45,000,000. Dividends are payable to the holders of the Junior Preferred Stock at 7.92% per annum, cumulative until the fifth anniversary of the issuance thereof and thereafter at increasing rates up to 18%. The dividends on the Junior Preferred Stock are cumulative and were being accrued at the initial rate of 7.92% through September 30, 2000, since it was Stations&#146 intention to redeem the Junior Preferred Stock prior to the fifth anniversary. During October 2000, Stations determined that redemption of the Junior Preferred Stock would most likely occur subsequent to the fifth anniversary. Accordingly, Stations began to accrue dividends in October 2000 under the effective cost method on a prospective basis based on the carrying value at October 1, 2000 to the liquidation preference at July 1, 2008. The effect of this change was to increase the loss per common share for the year ended December 31, 2000 by $(0.20). The change had no effect on income before extraordinary item or net income. Prior to June 5, 2001, dividend payments on the Junior Preferred Stock were not permitted to be made in cash and instead were added automatically to the liquidation preference and as a result are deemed paid in full.F-16PAGEBREAK STATIONS HOLDING COMPANY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#151 (Continued) The Junior Preferred Stock is subject to mandatory redemption in whole on July 1, 2008 and Stations has the option to redeem these shares in whole or in part at a price equal to the sum of the liquidation value per share plus an amount equal to all accumulated and unpaid dividends per share to the date of redemption. The following table summarizes these activities from December 31, 1999 through December 31, 2001 as follows: SeniorJuniorPreferredPreferredStockStock(In thousands)Balance at December 31, 1999 $122,092 $59,539 Accrued dividends 15,469 6,389 Accretion of redemption prepayment premium 2,075 &#151 Balance at December 31, 2000 $139,636 $65,928 Accrued dividends 16,135 12,977 Accretion of redemption prepayment premium 2,074 &#151 Balance at December 31, 2001 $157,845 $78,905 Initial Warrants At December 31, 2000 and 2001, there were 345,000 and 310,000 of outstanding Initial Warrants, respectively, which expire July 1, 2007. Each Initial Warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of class A common stock at an exercise price of $0.01 per share. The value of the Initial Warrants at the date of issuance was $9,000,000, which was allocated to paid-in capital. During September 1999, December 2000 and January 2001, Stations redeemed 185,000, 20,000, and 35,000 of the outstanding Initial Warrants for $2,957,000, $80,000 and $158,000, respectively. Discount Notes In June 1996, Stations issued Senior Subordinated Discount Notes due 2006 (the &#147 Discount Notes&#148 ) in the principal amount of $170,000,000. These Discount Notes were issued at a discount of $79,822,000, which generated gross proceeds of $90,178,000. The Discount Notes mature on May 15, 2006 and yield 13.25% per annum with no cash interest accruing prior to May 15, 2001. On May 15, 2001, cash interest began to accrue until maturity payable semiannually, commencing November 15, 2001. The Discount Notes are redeemable at the option of Stations, in whole or in part, at predetermined redemption prices and under specified conditions. The Discount Notes are subordinated to all other senior debt of Stations. The Discount Notes contain various restrictive covenants. The Discount Notes were exchanged for Discount Notes registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to a registration statement declared effective in October 1996. At December 31, 2000 and 2001 the accreted value of the notes was $147,546,000 and $154,670,000, respectively. The outstanding face value at December 31, 2000 and 2001 was $154,670,000. Stations is currently in default on the Discount Notes as Stations was unable to make the November 15, 2001 interest payment as Stations&#146 senior lenders under the Credit Facility blocked the payment of interest due on the Discount Notes as discussed in (Note Q). The entire outstanding balance of the Discount Notes of $154,670,000 has been classified as a current liability as a result of the default and related uncertainty.F-17PAGEBREAK STATIONS HOLDING COMPANY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#151 (Continued) Since Stations derives all of its operating income and cash flow from Benedek Stations&#146 ability to pay its obligations, including (i) interest on and principal of the Discount Notes, (ii) redemption of and cash dividends on the Senior Preferred Stock and (iii) redemption of and cash dividends on the Junior Preferred Stock, will be dependent primarily upon receiving dividends and other payments or advances from Benedek. Benedek is a separate and distinct legal entity and has no legal obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amount to Stations or to make funds available to Stations for debt service or any other obligation.(Note G) &#151 Long Term Debt(1) Notes payable Term Loans and Revolver On May 20, 1999, Stations borrowed $275,000,000 against a credit facility (the &#147 Credit Facility&#148 ), which was amended as of June 18, 1999 and March 22, 2000, with an aggregate borrowing limit of $310,000,000. The proceeds were used by Stations to finance the tender offer of its 11.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2005 (the &#147 Senior Secured Notes&#148 ) and extinguish the then existing credit agreement. The Credit Facility includes a $220,000,000 term loan (the &#147 Term Loan&#148 ) and a $90,000,000 revolver (the &#147 Revolver&#148 ) of which no additional borrowings were available at December 31, 2001 due to covenant violations discussed below. The Term Loan bears interest, at Stations&#146 option, at a base rate plus 2.25% or at a LIBOR rate plus 3.25%. The Revolver bears interest, at Stations&#146 option, at a base rate plus 1.00% to 1.75% or at a LIBOR rate plus 2.00% to 2.75%. The margins above the base rate and the LIBOR rate at which the Revolver bears interest is reduced when certain leverage ratios decrease. The interest rate on the Term Loan was 7.0% and the interest rate on the Revolver was 6.5% at December 31, 2001. In addition, Stations has accrued for an additional 2.0% interest on the Term Loan and Revolver since September 17, 2001 due to a default interest rate provision which became effective when a forebearance agreement with the lenders expired. The unused portion of the Revolver is subject to a commitment fee ranging from 0.75% per annum to 0.375% per annum based on certain leverage ratios. Stations is required to make scheduled payments on the Term Loan beginning in 2002 to maturity in 2007. In addition, Stations is required to make prepayments on the Term Loan and the Revolver under certain circumstances, including upon the sale of certain assets and the issuance of certain debt or equity securities. Beginning in 2002, Stations is required to make prepayments on the Term Loan and the Revolver in an amount equal to 50% of excess cash flow, which will require a payment of approximately $2,664,000 on or prior to April 30, 2002. The commitment under the Revolver will be permanently reduced over the period from June 2002 to maturity in 2007. In addition, the commitment under the Revolver will be permanently reduced in certain circumstances including upon the sale of certain assets and the issuance of certain debt or equity securities and with excess cash flow. Stations has the right to pay down the Revolver without penalty in increments of $1,000,000. The Credit Facility contains certain financial covenants, including, but not limited to, covenants related to interest coverage, total and senior leverage ratios and fixed charge ratio. In addition, the Credit Facility contains other affirmative and negative covenants relating to, among other things, liens, payments on other debt, restricted junior payments (excluding distributions from Benedek to Stations), transactions with affiliates, mergers and acquisitions, sales of assets, guarantees and investments. The Credit Facility contains customary events of default for highly-leveraged financings, including certain changes in ownership or control of Stations. The Credit Facility is secured by Stations&#146 present and future property and assets and the common stock of Benedek License Corporation.F-18PAGEBREAK STATIONS HOLDING COMPANY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#151 (Continued) Stations is currently in default under the Credit Facility due to Stations being in violation of certain covenants since June 30, 2001. At December 31, 2001 Stations was not in compliance with the senior debt ratio, total leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio under the Credit Facility. The non-compliance results from the decline in operating results during 2001. The entire outstanding balance under the Credit Facility of $276,000,000 has been classified as a current liability as a result of the default and related uncertainty. Other Notes Other notes payable consist of multiple financing agreements requiring monthly payments including interest from 0.9% to 11.6% on notes maturing from 2002 through 2021 that are collateralized by various assets of Stations.

Stations has the option to purchase the premises upon written notice to the landlord at any time during the 20-year term, which expires April 27, 2018. At December 31, 2001, the option purchase price was $1,415,000.(2) Interest Rate Cap During September 2001, in accordance with certain covenants of the Credit Facility, Stations entered into an interest rate cap agreement which matures in September 2003, to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on its floating-rate long-term debt. That agreement effectively entitles Stations to receive from a financial institution the amount, if any, by which the British Bankers&#146 Association interest settlement rates (&#147 settlement rate&#148 ) for U.S. dollar deposits exceeds 6.00% on a notional amount totaling $60,000,000 subject to an amortization schedule. As of December 31, 2001, the settlement rate was 1.90%.F-19PAGEBREAK STATIONS HOLDING COMPANY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#151 (Continued)The $95,000 premium paid for this interest rate cap is being amortized ratably to interest expense over the 24-month term of the cap, and is reported as an other asset in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The carrying value of the interest rate cap at December 31, 2001 materially approximates fair value. Although Stations is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty on the interest rate cap, management does not expect nonperformance by the counterparty.(3) Gain (Loss) on Extinguishment of Debt On April 16, 1999, Stations commenced a tender offer and consent solicitation (the &#147 Offer&#148 ) for any and all of the $135,000,000 in outstanding principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes. The total consideration for each of $1,000 principal of Senior Secured Notes was $1,105.78 which consisted of the Offer price per $1,000 principal of Senior Secured Notes of $1,075.78 and a consent payment of $30 per $1,000 principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes. On May 20, 1999, Stations redeemed all of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes. The offer was financed through the Credit Facility. A total of $12,510,000 (net of $8,340,000 of applicable income taxes) was reflected as a loss on the early extinguishment of debt which was comprised of prepayment premiums, consent payments, expenses of the transaction and a write-off of unamortized fees associated with the Senior Secured Notes and the then existing credit agreement. During July 1999, Stations retired a portion of its Discount Notes with a face amount of $3,000,000. The Discount Notes had an accreted value of $2,371,000 and were purchased for a total of $2,591,000, which includes a premium payment for early retirement. The premium payment, totaling $220,000, is included in other interest expense. During 2000, Stations retired portions of its Discount Notes with a total face amount of $12,330,000. The Discount Notes had an accreted value of $11,390,000 and were purchased for a total of $9,820,000. A total of $942,000 (net of $628,000 of applicable income taxes) was reflected as a gain on the early extinguishment of debt.(Note H) &#151 Program Broadcast Rights and Liabilities Program broadcast rights and program broadcast liabilities consist of the following: ProgramProgramBroadcastBroadcastRightsLiabilities(In thousands)Balance at December 31, 1999 $7,114 $9,586 Contracts acquired 8,100 8,100 Net addition due to station swap (Note B) 572 522 Amortization (9,015) &#151 Payments &#151 (8,691) Balance at December 31, 2000 6,771 9,517 Contracts acquired 10,783 10,783 Amortization (9,276) &#151 Payments &#151 (8,873) Balance at December 31, 2001 $8,278 $11,427 F-20PAGEBREAK STATIONS HOLDING COMPANY, INC.

Considerable judgment was required, however, to interpret market data to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented below are not necessarily indicative of the amounts Stations could realize in a current market exchange. Cash and cash equivalents, current receivables and current payables have carrying values which approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of those instruments. The floating rate long-term debt carrying amount approximates fair value because the interest rate fluctuates with the bank&#146 s lending rate. The interest rate cap agreement is carried at fair value.F-24PAGEBREAK STATIONS HOLDING COMPANY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#151 (Continued) The following table shows the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of other financial instrument liabilities at December 31, 2000 and 2001: 20002001CarryingEstimatedCarryingEstimatedAmountFair ValueAmountFair Value(In thousands)Program broadcast liabilities $9,517 $9,081 $11,427 $11,002 Other notes payable 6,896 6,896 6,702 6,702 Discount Notes 147,546 119,096 154,670 112,909 Senior Preferred Stock 139,636 47,152 157,845 30,179 Junior Preferred Stock 65,928 22,078 78,905 See Below The fair value of program broadcast liabilities and other notes payable were estimated using the discounted cash flow method. The fair value of the Discount Notes and Senior Preferred Stock were estimated using readily available quoted market prices. The fair value of the Junior Preferred Stock at December 31, 2000 was estimated using discounted cash flow analysis, based on the interest rate, preferences and other risks inherent in the instrument. Due to Stations&#146 current financial position and the lack of available market prices, the fair value of the Junior Preferred Stock was not practicable to be estimated at December 31, 2001. The above fair value estimates were made at a discrete point in time based on relevant market information and other assumptions about the financial instruments. As no active market exists for a significant portion of Stations&#146 financial instruments, fair value estimates were based on judgments regarding current economic conditions future expected cash flows, risk characteristics and other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and, therefore, cannot be calculated with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect these estimates.(Note N) &#151 Pending Adoption of Accounting Standards In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued two statements &#151 Statement 141 &#147 Business Combinations&#148 and Statement 142 &#147 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,&#148 which will impact Stations&#146 accounting for its goodwill and other intangible assets. Stations will be required to adopt these pronouncements for its 2002 financial statements. Statement 141 &#147 Business Combinations&#148 : &#149 Eliminates the pooling method of accounting for business combinations. &#149 Requires that intangible assets that meet certain criteria be reported separately from goodwill. &#149 Requires that negative goodwill arising from a business combination is recorded as an extraordinary gain. Statement 142 &#147 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets&#148 : &#149 Eliminates the amortization of goodwill and other intangibles that are determined to have an indefinite life. &#149 Requires, at a minimum, annual impairment tests for goodwill and other intangible assets that are determined to have an indefinite life.F-25PAGEBREAK STATIONS HOLDING COMPANY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#151 (Continued) Upon adoption of these statements, Stations is required to: &#149 Evaluate its existing intangible assets and goodwill that were acquired in prior purchase business combinations and to make any necessary reclassifications in order to conform to the new criteria. &#149 Reassess the useful lives of intangible assets and adjust the remaining amortization periods accordingly. In accordance with Statement 142, Stations stopped amortizing its goodwill and FCC licenses upon adoption on January 1, 2002. Stations also revised the amortization periods for its network affiliation agreements from 40 years to the remaining term of the applicable agreement. As of January 1, 2002, Stations also performed the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets, from which no impairment loss was identified. A reconciliation of previously reported net loss applicable to common stock and basic and diluted loss per share to the amounts adjusted for the exclusion of goodwill and FCC license amortization and for the adjustment to network affiliation agreement amortization, net of applicable income taxes, follow: Years Ended December 31,199920002001(In thousands, except per share data)Reported net loss before extraordinary item applicable to common stock $(34,764) $(9,099) $(76,601)Add back: Goodwill amortization 4,415 3,590 3,389 FCC license amortization 2,054 2,658 2,842 Adjust network affiliation agreement amortization (6,188) (6,188) (6,188) Adjusted net loss before extraordinary item applicable to common stock $(34,483) $(9,039) $(76,558)Extraordinary item (12,510) 942 &#151 Adjusted net loss applicable to common stock $(46,993) $(8,097) $(76,558) Reported basic and diluted loss per share before extraordinary item $(4.70) $(1.23) $(10.35)Add back: Goodwill amortization 0.60 0.49 0.46 FCC license amortization 0.28 0.36 0.38 Adjust network affiliation agreement amortization (0.84) (0.84) (0.84) Adjusted basic and diluted loss per share before extraordinary item $(4.66) $(1.22) $(10.35)Extraordinary item (1.69) 0.13 &#151 Adjusted basic and diluted loss per share $(6.35) $(1.09) $(10.35) (Note O) &#151 Early Adoption of Accounting Standard In October 2001, the FASB issued Statement 144, &#147 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,&#148 which establishes accounting and reporting standards for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. This statement supercedes Statement 121 &#147 Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of.&#148 Statement 144 provides one accounting model toF-26PAGEBREAK STATIONS HOLDING COMPANY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#151 (Continued)be used for long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale, whether previously held for use or newly acquired, and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions. The provisions of Statement 144 are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, however, as permitted by the Statement, Stations has elected to early adopt Statement 144 as of January 1, 2001, and the accompanying financial statements have been prepared with the Station Group and WTRF-TV accounted for as discontinued operations in accordance with Statement 144. The adoption of this Statement had no effect on net loss for the year ended December 31, 2001.(Note P) &#151 Commitments In accordance with FCC regulations, Stations is required to provide digital advanced television transmission (&#147 DTV&#148 ) for each of its television stations by May 1, 2002. The conversion to DTV from current analog transmissions will require a substantial capital outlay by Stations and has been completed at one of the television stations. Stations has requested six-month extensions for each of the remaining stations which are currently pending with the FCC. Stations estimates the total costs associated with the conversion to be approximately $18,700,000. Approximately $4,147,000 has been incurred at December 31, 2001, with the remainder to be incurred in 2002 and beyond. In connection with the conversion to DTV, Stations has entered into an agreement to purchase twelve digital transmitters for approximately $4,990,000.(Note Q) &#151 Management Plans, Continuing Operations and Subsequent Events Stations is currently in default under its Credit Facility due to the violation of certain covenants since June 30, 2001. The senior lenders under the Credit Facility thus blocked the payment of approximately $10,247,000 of cash interest due to the holders of the Discount Notes on November 15, 2001. The payment blockage is for a period of 179 days commencing on November 7, 2001. Due to this payment blockage, Stations has not yet made the November 15, 2001 interest payment and is in default under the Discount Notes. In response to the above, Stations has been actively seeking to reduce its debt burden since February 2001. These efforts include, among other things, potential asset or stock sales. The Stations&#146 efforts to sell assets and reduce indebtedness are designed to enable Stations to service and/or prepay its debt obligations. In addition to potential asset and stock sales, Stations continues to explore other alternatives to address its cash interest obligations on the Discount Notes and its non-compliance with the Credit Facility. The events of September 11, 2001 and their adverse impact on Stations&#146 liquidity, together with the difficult advertising revenue climate that continued through the end of 2001, have negatively impacted some of the alternatives that were previously available to Stations. Stations has held extensive negotiations with certain holders of the Discount Notes and other constituents in an attempt to obtain additional liquidity or otherwise address the outstanding defaults under the Discount Notes and the Credit Facility. Notwithstanding many weeks of intense discussions, Stations has been unable to accomplish an out of court restructuring with its constituents. Therefore, on March 22, 2002 Stations filed for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code to fully explore all available strategic alternatives in order to identify the option that will best maximize value for Stations&#146 constituents. On April 1, 2002 Stations signed a letter of intent with Gray Communications Systems, Inc. (&#147 Gray&#148 ), whereby Gray will acquire 100% of the capital stock of Stations for a cash payment of $500,000,000 less the amount of debt assumed at closing. The transaction is subject to execution of a definitive agreement as well as approval by the FCC of the transfer of control of Stations&#146 FCC licenses. The transaction is also subject to approval by the Delaware bankruptcy court with jurisdiction over the Chapter 11 reorganization of Stations. The transaction is expected to close by the fourth quarter of 2002.F-27PAGEBREAK STATIONS HOLDING COMPANY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#151 (Continued) On April 30, 2002, Stations completed the sale of the television broadcast assets of WTRF-TV to West Virginia Media. See (Note B). On June 4, 2002, Stations executed a merger agreement with Gray whereby Stations will become a subsidiary of Gray in exchange for approximately $502,500,000 in cash, a substantial portion of which will be used to satisfy, in full, certain indebtedness of Stations. As part of the merger agreement, Stations and Gray agreed to sell the assets of eight television stations (the &#147 Station Group&#148 ) to a third party prior to the merger with Gray. On June 4, 2002, Stations also signed an agreement with a third party to sell the Station Group for a sales price of $30,000,000 less assumed indebtedness. The Station Group and WTRF-TV have been accounted for as discontinued operations under SFAS No. 144 for each period presented. The assets and liabilities of the Station Group and WTRF-TV consist of the following at December 31: 20002001(In thousands)Assets Accounts receivable $8,080 $7,438 Program broadcast rights 2,281 2,783 Property and equipment 20,389 19,041 Goodwill 35,277 10,729 Intangible assets 44,027 41,542 Other 886 1,107 Total $110,940 $82,640 Liabilities Notes and leases payable $2,219 $1,921 Accounts payable and accrued expenses 2,297 3,133 Program broadcast liabilities 3,151 2,741 Deferred taxes 13,106 12,217 Other 1,307 1,017 Total $22,080 $21,029 The assets of WTRF-TV are separately classified as &#147 Assets of station held for sale&#148 at December 31, 2001.

Excluding writedowns to fair value and losses on sale of $(2,984,000) in 1999 and $(24,553,000) in 2001, the amount of loss before income taxes included in discontinued operations for the years ended

STATEMENTS(Note A) &#151 Nature of Business and Basis of Presentation Nature of Business Stations is a holding company with minimal operations other than from its wholly owned subsidiary, Benedek. Stations&#146 owns and operates twenty-three television stations located throughout the United States. Stations&#146 revenues are derived primarily from the sale of advertising time and, to a modest extent from compensation paid by the networks for broadcasting network programming and barter transactions for goods and services. The television stations sell commercial time during the programs to national, regional and local advertisers. The networks also sell commercial time during the programs to national advertisers. Credit arrangements are determined on an individual customer basis. Segment information is not presented since all of Stations&#146 revenue is attributed to a single reportable segment. Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Stations and Benedek. Benedek includes three wholly owned subsidiaries, Benedek License Corporation, Benedek Cable, Inc. and Benedek Interactive Media, LLC. All significant intercompany items and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. On March 22, 2002, Stations filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. Benedek and its subsidiaries are not party to the bankruptcy action. Under Chapter 11, certain claims against the Debtor in existence prior to the filing of the petitions for relief under the federal bankruptcy laws are stayed while the Debtor continues business operations as Debtor-in-possession. These claims are reflected in the March 31, 2002 balance sheet as &#147 Liabilities subject to compromise.&#148 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that Stations will continue as a going concern. Stations is in default under its credit facility and senior subordinated discount notes and Stations has filed for bankruptcy relief as described above. These facts raise substantial doubt with respect to Stations&#146 ability to continue as a going concern. Management&#146 s plans in regard to these matters are described in Note D below. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty, other than the classification of Stations&#146 credit facility, which totals $276,000,000, the Discount Notes of $154,670,000, and the interest due on the Discount Notes of $17,477,000, as a portion of liabilities subject to compromise. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared consistent with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and the instructions for Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Some of the information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. It is recommended that these financial statements be read along with the annual financial statements and footnotes thereto of Stations for the year ended December 31, 2001 included elsewhere in this report.(Note B) &#151 Commitments In accordance with FCC regulations, the stations are required to provide digital advanced television transmission (&#147 DTV&#148 ) by May 1, 2002. The conversion to DTV from the current analog transmissions will require a substantial capital outlay by Stations and has been completed at one of the stations. The company has requested six month extensions for each of the remaining stations which are currently pending with the FCC. Stations estimates the total costs associated with the conversion to be approximately $18,700,000. Approximately $4,671,000 has been incurred at March 31, 2002, with the remainder to be incurred in 2002 and beyond. In connection with the conversion to DTV, Stations enteredF-34PAGEBREAK STATIONS HOLDING COMPANY, INC., DEBTOR-IN-POSSESSION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#151 (Continued)into a strategic alliance agreement that requires Stations to purchase twenty-five transmitters for an amount that represents approximately $10,400,000. Through March 31, 2002, Stations had received and substantially completed payment on eight of the transmitters.(Note C) &#151 Adoption of Accounting Standards Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 On January 1, 2002, Stations adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141 &#147 Business Combinations and SFAS No. 142 &#147 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.&#148 SFAS No. 141 requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001, and also specifies the criteria for recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill. SFAS No. 142, requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but instead be tested for impairment upon adoption and at least annually thereafter in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Stations stopped amortizing its goodwill and FCC licenses upon adoption on January 1, 2002. Amortization expense related to the goodwill and FCC licenses for the three-month period ended March 31, 2001 was approximately $1,548,000 (net of $500,000 of applicable income taxes). Stations also revised the amortization periods for its network affiliation agreements from 40 years to the remaining term of the applicable agreement. As of January 1, 2002, Stations also performed the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets, from which no impairment loss was identified. A reconciliation of previously reported net loss applicable to common stock and basic and diluted loss per share to the amounts adjusted for the exclusion of goodwill and FCC license amortization and for the adjustment to network affiliation agreement amortization, net of applicable income taxes, follow: Three Months EndedMarch 31,20012002(In thousands, exceptper share data)Reported net loss applicable to common stock $(15,834) $(36,154)Add back: Goodwill amortization 838 &#151 FCC license amortization 710 &#151 Adjust network affiliation agreement amortization (1,571) &#151 Adjusted net loss applicable to common stock $(15,857) $(36,154) Reported basic and diluted loss per share $(2.14) $(4.89)Add back: Goodwill amortization 0.11 &#151 FCC license amortization 0.10 &#151 Adjust network affiliation agreement amortization (0.21) &#151 Adjusted basic and diluted loss per share $(2.14) $(4.89) F-35PAGEBREAK STATIONS HOLDING COMPANY, INC., DEBTOR-IN-POSSESSION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#151 (Continued) The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the three-month period ended March 31, 2002 are as follows: (In thousands)Balance as of January 1, 2002. $83,210 Writedown associated with stations held for sale (4,803) Goodwill reclassified as asset of stations held for sale (308) Balance as of March 31, 2002. $78,099 The composition of Stations&#146 intangible assets and associated accumulated amortization is as follows as of March 31, 2002: Gross CarryingAccumulatedAssets HeldNet CarryingAmountAmortizationFor SaleAmount(In thousands)Intangible assets subject to amortization: Network affiliation agreements $104,261 $26,225 $8,839 $69,197 Other 2,736 1,527 74 1,135 Intangible assets not subject to amortization $106,997 $27,752 8,913 $70,332 FCC licenses 148,132 &#151 5,341 142,791 Total intangible assets $255,129 $27,752 $14,254 $213,123 The aggregate amortization expense for the three month periods ended March 31, 2001 and 2002 totaled $2,704,000 and $3,286,000, respectively. Estimated amortization expense for each of the years ending December 31, 2002 through 2006 is approximately $8,700,000 per year. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 On January 1, 2001, Stations adopted SFAS No. 144 &#147 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets&#148 which provides accounting and disclosure guidance for the impairment of long-lived assets and long-lived assets to be disposed of. On April 1, 2002, Stations signed the letter of intent with Gray Communications Systems, Inc. (&#147 Gray&#148 ) , which is described more fully in Note D along with the resulting merger agreement. Included in that agreement, Stations agreed to sell all assets of eight television stations (&#147 Station Group&#148 ) to a third party prior to the merger with Gray. On June 4, 2002, Stations signed an agreement with a third party to sell the Station Group for a sales price of $30,000,000 less assumed indebtedness. This sale is to close before the merger agreement with Gray is consummated, which will most likely occur in the fourth quarter of 2002. On November 26, 2001 Stations entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with West Virginia Media Holdings, LLC (&#147 West Virginia Media&#148 ) pursuant to which, on April 30, 2002, Stations sold the television broadcast assets of WTRF-TV, in Wheeling, West Virginia to West Virginia Media for $18,500,000. Stations recorded a lower of cost or market adjustment of approximately $6,880,000 in the fourth quarter of 2001 to write down the assets of WTRF-TV to the sales price. The Station Group and WTRF-TV have been classified as stations held for sale at March 31, 2002 and have accordingly been accounted for as discontinued operations under SFAS No. 144.F-36PAGEBREAK STATIONS HOLDING COMPANY, INC., DEBTOR-IN-POSSESSION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#151 (Continued) The assets and liabilities of the stations classified as held for sale at March 31, 2002 consist of the following: December 31,March 31,20012002(In thousands)Assets Accounts receivable $7,438 $5,907 Program broadcast rights 2,783 2,131 Property and equipment 19,041 18,420 Goodwill 10,729 5,926 Intangible assets 41,542 14,254 Other 1,107 1,203 Total $82,640 $47,841 Liabilities Notes and leases payable $1,921 $1,757 Accounts payable and accrued expenses 3,133 1,970 Program broadcast liabilities 2,741 2,950 Deferred taxes 12,217 1,330 Other 1,017 960 Total $21,029 $8,967 At March 31, 2002 Stations recorded a write-down before income taxes of approximately $31,288,000. This writedown was needed to adjust the carrying value of the stations held for sale to their fair value. For the three months ended March 31, 2001 and 2002, the net revenues included in discontinued operations for the stations held for sale were $8,350,000 and $8,081,000, respectively. Excluding a writedown to fair value of $(31,288,000) in 2002, the amount of loss before income taxes included in discontinued operations for the three months ended March 31, 2001 and 2002 was $(2,371,000) and $(2,209,000), respectively.(Note D) &#150 Management Plans, Continuing Operations and Subsequent Events Stations has been in default under its Credit Facility due to the violation of certain covenants since June 30, 2001. The senior lenders under the credit facility thus blocked the payment of approximately $10,247,000 of cash interest due to the holders of the Senior Subordinated Discount Notes (&#147 Discount Notes&#148 ). Due to this payment blockage, Stations has not yet made the November 15, 2001 interest payment and is in default under the Discount Notes. In response to the above, Stations has been actively seeking to reduce its debt burden since February 2001. These efforts included, among other things, potential asset or stock sales. Stations&#146 efforts to sell assets and reduce indebtedness were designed to enable Stations to service and/or prepay their debt obligations. In addition to potential asset and stock sales, Stations continued to explore other alternatives to address its cash interest obligations on the Discount Notes and its non-compliance with the Credit Facility. However, the events of September 11, 2001 and their adverse impact on Stations&#146 liquidity together with the difficult advertising revenue climate that continued through the end of 2001, negatively impacted some of the alternatives that were previously available to Stations.F-37PAGEBREAK STATIONS HOLDING COMPANY, INC., DEBTOR-IN-POSSESSION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#151 (Continued) Stations held extensive negotiations with certain holders of the Discount Notes and other constituents in an attempt to obtain additional liquidity or otherwise address the outstanding defaults under the Discount Notes and the Credit Facility. Notwithstanding many weeks of intense discussions, Stations was unable to accomplish an out of court restructuring with its constituents. Therefore, on March 22, 2002 Stations filed for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code to fully explore all available strategic alternatives in order to identify the option that would best maximize value for Stations&#146 constituents. On April 1, 2002 Stations signed a letter of intent with Gray and on June 4, 2002 Stations executed a merger agreement with Gray whereby Stations will become a subsidiary of Gray in exchange for approximately $502,500,000 in cash. This amount anticipates payment in full of the Credit Facility and Discount Notes and partial payment to the holders of the Senior Preferred Stock and the Junior Preferred Stock. Stations and Gray agreed in the merger agreement to the disposition by Stations of the Station Group. On June 4, 2002 Stations thus entered into an agreement to sell the Station Group to a third party for a sales price of $30,000,000 less assumed indebtedness. The proceeds of the transaction, which is a condition of closing pursuant to the merger agreement, will be consummated immediately prior to the closing of the merger agreement with Gray, will be used to repay in part Stations&#146 lenders under the Credit Facility. The merger agreement with Gray and the sale of the Station Group are expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2002.F-38PAGEBREAK Item 7.
