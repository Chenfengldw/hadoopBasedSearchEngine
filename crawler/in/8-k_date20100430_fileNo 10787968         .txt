On April 29, 2010, Gray Television, Inc. (&#147 Gray&#148 , &#147 we&#148 or the &#147 Company&#148 ) issued $365,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 101/2% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2015 (the &#147 Notes&#148 ) pursuant to an indenture, dated April 29, 2010, between Gray, the subsidiary guarantors named therein (collectively, the &#147 Guarantors&#148 ) and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the &#147 Indenture&#148 ). The Notes were offered and sold either to &#147 qualified institutional buyers&#148 pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933 (the &#147 Securities Act&#148 ) or to persons outside the United States under Regulation S of the Securities Act. The Notes mature on June 29, 2015. Interest accrues on the Notes from April 29, 2010, and interest is payable semiannually, on May 1 and November 1of each year. The first interest payment date is November 1, 2010. We may redeem some or all of the Notes at any time after November 1, 2012 at specified redemption prices. We may also redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes using the proceeds from certain equity offerings completed before November 1, 2012. In addition, we may redeem some or all of the Notes at any time prior to November 1, 2012 at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus a make whole premium set forth in the Indenture, and accrued and unpaid interest. If we sell certain of our assets or experience specific kinds of changes of control, we must offer to repurchase the Notes. The terms of the Notes are set out in detail in the Indenture. The Notes and related guarantees are Gray&#146 s and the Guarantors&#146 senior secured obligations. The Notes and guarantees: &#149 rank senior in right of payment to Gray&#146 s and the Guarantors&#146 existing and future debt and other obligations that expressly provide for their subordination to the Notes and the guarantees &#149 are effectively senior to Gray&#146 s and the Guarantors&#146 existing and future unsecured debt to the extent of the value of the collateral securing the Notes, after giving effect to first-priority liens on the collateral and permitted liens &#149 are effectively junior to Gray&#146 s and the Guarantors&#146 obligations that are either (i) secured by first priority liens on the collateral, including indebtedness under Gray&#146 s senior credit facility or (ii) secured by assets that are not part of the collateral that is securing the Notes, in each case to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such debt and &#149 are structurally subordinated to all of the existing and future liabilities of Gray&#146 s subsidiaries, if any, that do not guarantee the Notes. The Notes and the guarantees are secured by a second priority lien on substantially all of the assets owned by Gray and the Guarantors, including, among other things, all present and future shares of capital stock, equipment, owned real property, leaseholds and fixtures, in each case subject to certain exceptions and customary permitted liens (the &#147 Notes Collateral&#148 ). The Notes Collateral also secures obligations under Gray&#146 s senior credit facility, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens. In connection with the issuance of the Notes, Gray, the Guarantors and the initial purchasers of the Notes entered into a Registration Rights Agreement (the &#147 Registration Rights Agreement&#148 ), dated April 29, 2010. The Registration Rights Agreement requires Gray to use its best efforts to file an exchange offer registration statement with the SEC relating to the Notes within 270 days after the date the Notes were issued, and to consummate such exchange offer on or before the 360th day after the date the Notes were issued. If, under certain circumstances, an exchange offer is not completed within the required timeframe, Gray must use its best efforts to cause a shelf registration statement covering resales of the Notes to be declared effective, as promptly as practicable, and must keep such shelf registration statement effective until the earlier of (i) the second anniversary of the original issue date of the Notes and (ii) the date all Notes covered by the shelf registration statement have been sold as contemplated in the shelf registration statement. If Gray fails to satisfy its obligations under the Registration Rights Agreement, it will, under certain circumstances, be required to pay additional interest to the holders of the Notes. Gray used the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes to (i) repay a portion of its term loans outstanding, (ii) repurchase a portion of the outstanding shares of its Series D perpetual preferred stock (the &#147 Series D Stock&#148 ) and (iii) pay related fees and expenses, including advisory fees.Folio2/FolioPAGEBREAK Copies of the Indenture, including the form of the Notes, and the Registration Rights Agreement are attached to this current report on Form 8-K as exhibits and are incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein.
