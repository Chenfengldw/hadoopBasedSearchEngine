(the "Company"), notified the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") that it was not in compliance with Section 303A.03 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual. Section 303A.03 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual requires a listed company to name in its proxy statement for its annual meeting of shareholders the name of the director chosen to preside at executive sessions of non-management directors. The Company inadvertently failed to disclose in its proxy statement for the 2005 annual meeting of shareholders that, pursuant to the Company&#x2019 s Corporate Governance Principals, William E. Mayher, III, Chairman of the Board of the Company, presides over all meetings of the Company&#x2019 s non-management directors. In addition, under the Company&#x2019 s Corporate Governance Principals, in the event Dr. Mayher is not present at any meeting of the non-management directors, one of the other non-management directors serves as the presiding officer of such meeting, with responsibility for presiding over such meetings rotating among the non-management directors on an alphabetical basis.We believe that the filing of this Current Report on 8-K will bring the Company into compliance with Section 303A.03 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual.Item ENDPageBreak STARTTop of the FormPageBreak ENDSignatureHeader STARTSIGNATURESPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.SignatureHeader ENDSignature START Gray Television, Inc.
